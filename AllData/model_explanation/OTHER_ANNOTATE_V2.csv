We waited standing with our carryons for over 45minutes. Nobody knew what was happening or when they will start boarding. Naturally, when we finally got on board people where blocking the aisle because Aegean didn’t bother to board from back to front as it is usually done.

145," PDX - DUBPoints positifs : Great equipment. Decent entertainment, sparsely filled cabin. Seat change to isle request before boarding readily made with no fuss. I noticed that passengers could actually make out pa announcements both at PDX and in flight. Doesn’t bother me anymore when I can’t but can be very concerning to anyone who rarely flies. Never understood going to the trouble of making announcements both pre-boarding & on-board pre-flight, that no one can even make out. That was not an issue here. Points négatifs : Better lumbar support is always appreciated, adjustable lumbar would be very nice and could make or break an entire flight. No seat on any flight should ever be even the slightest ill repaired. Again, this equipmemt all seemed great. Lastly, since I prefer to always have a water, coke or coffe and or snack in front of me during entire flight, a bit of self serve (grab a water, coffee or snack yourself without having to make staff work a simple task would be nice on every flight. The flight from SEA-DUB was basically great and equipment is always of the utmost importantance.  ",-1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0

Points négatifs : It was hard coming home since we can't bring any food with meat on the international flight coming back to the USA. Or at least the food I brought, a sandwich was not allowed because of customs. I can't eat the food that was offered. I'm glutten intolerant and dairy involerant. Not sure there's a whole lot to do about it besides buy prepackaged food that don't have meat, vegtabjes or fruit. Protien bars may have worked. 

We brought two bottles of water each from the terminal. I could have used more, even with the drink service.

154," Worst Customer ServicePoints positifs : I liked the service once we left Dublin but once it was time to arrive to Leeds everything went downhill. Points négatifs : Our flight did not land to Leeds but to Manchester. I thought this would not be an issue to get my connecting flight to London. As I tried to explain to the airline attendants about my connecting flight they had no idea what was going on and said it wasn't their issue I would have to go to Leeds and explain to them what was happening. I asked if there was a way we could call them and see if I could just get a flight to London from Manchester. They said no. I tried to get a number to call myself still nothing. They sent everyone from the flight onto a coach bus to Leeds. Once I arrived to Leeds, I spoke with Ben and explained my situation. He said there were no more flights to London or anywhere near there. And there wasn't any flights to Austin, TX which was my end point either. He explained there wasn't anything they could do except fly me in the morning to London. I agreed but then come to find out he had to send me back to Manchester. Now I had already had my arrangements to stay in London for the night so I did not have much money left. He said they would take care of the accommodations and the flight to London. I was VERY PATIENT. Within this he was telling me how close they were to closing. I explained I needed everything in place before they even left because I was traveling alone in an unknown country or city. He arranged a cab to take me back to Manchester and a hotel to stay in with dinner and breakfast available. I thought everything would get better but of course it didn't. Ben clearly knew I had my checked bag and carry on. When I'm about to board the flight to London they charged me 60 pounds for my CHECKED BAG. Now this was already included on flight to begin with if all of this had not happened. The attendant did not want to listen to my story and kept passing me to another attendant that said there's nothing they could do. I had to pay since I couldn't leave my belongings. Once i arrived to London. I had to get my bag and RECHECK IN MY BAG. AGAIN they tried to charge me for my checked bag. This time I had enough of your airline and explained it was all included in my flight and I went on a rant with the attendant. He just stared and printed out the ticket for my bag. Didn't look at the computer. Didn't even explain why it's all of sudden taken care of that I don't have to pay anymore. I had no patience to hear his excuse but just wanted to get back home. This has been the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. Frontier isn't even this unorganized. Shouldn't there be a process for these kind of situations already?

So Frankfurt airport was gracious enough to let us back through customs with our checked bags (after collecting them in baggage claim).

Emirates staff very helpful in helping me get on another flight.Points négatifs : When I arrived at the airport the next morning on January 1st 2017 to get on another flight, the lady at the OR Tambo Air Namibia ticketing office (her name is Happy) gave me a very hard time. She told me that the staff from the night before should not have put me in a hotel, and that she could not give me another flight. Her reason was that I had booked the flight through a travel agency website and so it was not Air Namibia's responsibility to get me on another flight. When I tried to explain to her why it was she started to yell at me. ""Don't tell me how to do my job"", she said. As I started to explain again that I paid for the flight and that Air Namibia surely received compensation and would not be out any money by placing me on another flight she told me to ""stop arguing"" with her.

I took my claim to the Emirates counter, very upset from a fight I did not need to have and lack of sleep the past two days of traveling. The Emirates staff called Happy over to explain to her why she should get me on a flight. Happy finally agreed, but by this time the flight was about to leave and I almost missed it. Because of her delay, I had to run through the airport, and my bag did not make it on. When I finally received my luggage a week later, it was broken and torn with the contents spilling out.

If Happy had better customer service skills and had helped me instead of giving me a hard time, I would not have had the horrible day that I did and resultant destroyed luggage.

In my opinion, she should be fired, and I strongly advise Emirates not to connect flights with this airline (who apparently makes these types of cancellations every year).

A bit more expensive than the low cost carriers, but better flight times and a normal flight experience (or what used to be normal) was their forte. Points négatifs : What I don't like. They don't know what they want to be. Not the crew or pilots, the executives.
In September AirBerlin changed their policy of serving 'free' food on flights. I understand that they are competing with the Low Cost carriers (especially as O'Leary has set his sights squarely on AirBerlin), but charging flights that cost more than double of a low cost, yet offering the same experience of a low cost is a sure way to lose customers. 
Case and point: Flight to Vienna, we were offered complimentary sandwiches and drinks. Return flight, they charged for drinks and food.

611," Avoid Jetairfly and TUIPoints positifs : Nothing possitve to say here.Points négatifs : I've flown hundreds of flights, and this was my first time with Justairfly (TUI), and it will be my last. In Brussels there was a mechanical failure and the flight was delayed. The problem was that it was delayed 14+ hours. Now sometimes things happen, I understand that, but how you handle those situations is something else. Jetsirfly handled this very very poorly, with complete disregard to its passengers. They would require us to return to the gate almost every 2 hours for the next 14 hours. Then when 200+ people return to the gate Jetairfy and their representatives would not be there. 

They violated many EU statutes regarding passengers rights. And when this was brought to their attention, they would become hostile, and violate more! For instance, by law, when the delay is five hours or longer, passengers may opt for reimbursement of the full cost of the ticket together with, when relevant, a return flight to the first point of departure. I specifically requested reimbursement and to be returned to my point of origin, and was flat out denied for Jetairfly!

By law, if a flight is delayed by four hours or more and the final destination is over 1500 kilometers, the passengers are required to compensation. Not only did they not compensate us, they failed to notify us, as required by law, of this compensation. 

In general, they did an extremely poor job of handling the situation and myself, and 100+ other passengers have reported them to the authorities.

I'll never fly or use Jetairfly or TUI again. And I suggest you avoid this. Airline at all costs. ",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0

We asked the desk where to check in for the our flight which was apparently already boarding, while the woman told us to go wait in line. After waiting in line for 30 minutes, the check in desk told us that it was too late to check in for the flight. This led us to spend over $1000 on a new flight home. Thank you TUIfly.

1) The crew seemed to be relatively inexperienced and just out of college. I observed a couple of informal communication exchanges from their part. But the crew were helpful and tried their best to provide the best customer experience.
2) The boarding process normally starts with business and premium class and then followed by economy. For my flight however the economy class was boarded first while the business class passengers were kept stranded waiting in a separate line. This also reflected the inexperience of the crew which handled the boarding.
3) Vistara was my connecting flight from Pune to Delhi followed by British airways flight from Delhi to London. Though the flights were booked under one ticket, the representative did not checkin my luggage throughout the journey due to which I had to collect my baggage at Delhi and check it in again. The representative explained that vistara still didn't have alliances with most airlines allowing luggage to be checked in till final destination. This is another front on which they can improve.

We were travelling with bb, w stroller, two suitcases, and one of suitcases was overweight. So instead of stepping in and talkinv to us politely in our native russian language he stayed away and was laughing with his coleague, until my husband was almost exploding from anger, barely understanding young chinese coleague. I fought w mg husband, our bb was crying and then.. iverall hirrible experience. Then , we sat on good seats, first row, assigned to us by nice stuff. I sat next to young pregnant russian lady, almost 8 months pregnant. She said she also hated that guy and she wanted to complain as well. She had only 1 luggage, carry on size, but that russian representative/manager/superviser told its nit cabin carry size. Which was not true. To the argument that its indeed is a cabin carry on size for all the other tines before~ he said he would fire the employee who would say so. Some people really can just spoil a day....

The pilot was communicative.Points négatifs : The staff were pushy and rude to me when they told me at the gate, when I was about to board, that I could not have a backpack and small purse. This is not what I understood when booking and is not clearly explained at the time of purchase. One attendant at the gate in particular was forceful and rude when insisting that I pay over $66 in cash at a moment when going to the ATM would mean potentially missing boarding and not arriving back in time to the gate. This process, which I agreed to because two staff members gave me the impression that I could not travel on the flight unless I paid right there instantly in CASH (completely ridiculous), caused me anxiety and took a long time, too long given the urgency of boarding the flight. I had to wait for change for 5 minutes and as a result, I was the last one to board. 

It should be noted that this process of paying for a maleta in hand at the gate had been preceded by having to pay over $20 in cash to print a boarding pass, which required another ATM withdrawal and fee. This is a weak and predatory business model, which seeks to exploit people’s need to travel and their anxiety.

- The plane was a backup aircraft-- not an Air Tanker plane, which was originally supposed to fly the route, but a Hi-Fly plane; and from the looks and feel of it, and the ""no cellphone"" stickers which looked like they came from the early 80's when cellphones were still giant bricks-- I'm not an airline technician, but this plane looked really rough. 

- I would not have bought a ticket on the airline if I knew I'd be flying almost 9 hours (which ended up being 12+ hours, since we sat on the runway for 3 hours) in this extremely shoddy, uncomfortable aircraft.

No electronics worked, there were lights missing, and the screens on the back of the seat in front of me was popping out of the seat. 

- The seat I received was the last row against the wall-- and it did NOT recline. I'm 6'3''. And the person in front of me decided they'd like to recline all the way back, so I spent most of the flight feeling like a sardine, with a broken screen popping out of the seat in my face.

Al adquirir los boletos en el propio mostrador nos indicaron que teníamos que dividir la maleta posteriormente revise la página electrónica y tampoco decía esto, he viajado de forma constante como mi familia, y es la primera compañía que no suma los kilos, lo cual en mi parecer es completamente ilógico, como pedirle a un niños de 5 años que lleve su maleta de 10 kilos?????.
Espero esto les sea de ayuda. Esta compañía es una subsidiaria de aerofoto me indicaron, y que él mismo aeroflot aplica los mismos en todos sus vuelos, así que tengan cuidado o infórmense mejor. ",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0

This isn't the first time using Dublin, Aer Lingus and the US Pre-clearance, but it was the first I used the automated entry machines, easy to use but for some reason the CBP guy did the whole finger print thing again when I handed the recipe from the machine to him, the CBP seem to be doing this with everyone.... it seems a waste of time  having the machines. As for the flight the experience was ok, my only criticism was the seat, I found it very uncomfortable after a few hours, the base had no cushion worth speaking of on it, all the seats are the same in economy, it is like sitting on a park bench,  I had a muscle on the back of my left leg hurting for a day or two after the flight.  The food was ok, as was the service from the crew, I wasn't impressed with the  entertainment but that is probably just me.  If the seat base had been better the whole flight would have been close to 100% (if  flying economy can ever be described that way) 
As I only have hand luggage the plus side to flying from Dublin and the using the pre-clearance is that 5 minutes from leaving the plane you can be out of the terminal  and on your way.

Check in was satisfactory compared to previous journeys I've taken with ""world class"" airlines such as Delta; Singapore; Emeriates; Ethiad; Turkish and British Airways. The cabin was dull and there was nothing of interest. I was very disappointed. I was expecting more for the cost of the ticket. Aer Lingus seriously needs to re-think it's cabin interior. I was disgusted when I entered the lavatory. It was of economy standards and looked ghastly compared to the first class lavatory on Emeriates. At this stage of the flight, the food was as I expected; inadequate and unacceptable. I was promised ""luxury dining"", but I received the contrary. The seat was cramped making an uncomfortable overall flying experience. Thankfully, the flight stewards were very professional greeting me with a smile the moment I stepped on the plane. They were extremely helpful throughout the entire flight and the service was great. The uniform may need to be updated though. If only we could transfer the stewards to a better company. I will not be travelling with Aer Lingus in the near future and I will not recommend Aer Lingus to any of my colleagues. Issues  with the cabin and food need to be dealt with right away and until these changes take place the first class flying community will be utterly disappointed with their time with Aer Lingus.",-1.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,2.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0

This was my first time on EI-DAA, and while it was okay, it wasn't brilliant.  When I boarded the plane, I headed for my seat - 40K.

I was one of the first down the back as I knew the amount of available overhead storage would be abysmal.  How abysmal became apparent as there were bins full of cardboard bassinets for people traveling with kids, to locked bins with items for the crew and little space for the paying customers.  I managed to get an overhead bin 2 seats up from me that was compartmentalized with 2 spaces - a space sized for one bag and the 2nd space had room for 3 other bags.  I managed to get the smaller compartment but others were less successful finding space when they managed to board. 
With regards to my seat, I had no-one beside me at takeoff.....but that changed not long into the flight.  A lady sitting in another seat experienced a failure with her headphone jack and decided to test other headphone jacks at empty seats and as the jack at the seat beside me worked, I inherited a seatmate who ended up encroaching on my space.

The seat space was tight, given the fuselage does narrow given the proximity to the tail but I had reasonably good leg room and it was a comfy Recaro seats.  Once airborne it wasn't too bad but the controller for the AVOD was battered to hell but still functioned.

The location and state of the restrooms left a lot to be desired.  From trying to get to any of them when the crew are working, to one restroom running out of paper towels and other passengers flushing items that should have been binned, they were kinda gross by the end of the flight.

Food was okay with the chance to buy snacks but soft drinks were free (I think - I was drinking water) and of course booze was available for purchase.

On the whole, the plane felt old and unloved and the rear galley was sad and in a sorry state.  While the crew were okay, it wasn't the best flight I ever had.  R.I.P to the Aer Lingus I once knew.

Pros:
Good AVOD choices, reasonably comfortable seating, 2 windows (for those people who like to look out and take snaps)

Cons:
Tight seating (shoulder to shoulder), if the person in front of you reclines their seat you are screwed, poor restroom sizes and locations, poor available space in the overhead bins and sad interior decoration.",1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Space saver seats meant that the legroom was very good. However, I wouldn't want to take a flight longer than an hour or so as the padding was minimal.

24B is actually the Exit row seat (shown on the plan as row 23) Great amount of legroom allowing you to stretch out during the flight. The seat was a little narrow but didn't cause a problem for myself...a larger size traveler may be uncomfortable.
Very close to the toilets on board (3 of) so people do congregate around the area. (Didn't cause too much of a problem but can be busy at certain times)
The plane is small for a transatlantic flight and this flight was extremely full with only 1 or 2 seats spare.
Food was OK quality (and served quickly) Took a long time to be cleared away though.

I think this plane is a bit small for transatlantic travel, but it was actually better than I expected. I am not fond of sitting in seats where you can't stow any luggage in front of you, as were these exit row seats, because it's not convenient to retrieve things during travel, and because the seats are slightly narrower due to having the tray tables in the armrest. I would probably try the ""more room"" seats in row 4 next time. We paid extra for the ""upgrade"" meal and it was a very generous amount of food (too much, actually!), and very tasty.

Flt was pretty good. When boarding there was two CSAs standing by asking passengers if they wouldnt mind checking your carry on luggage cause of overhead bins being full.  I agreed HUGE MISTAKE!!!  My luggage was misplaced for three days.  When you walk on board you are greeted with a smile and a Russian hello! And asked to see your boarding ticket even if you know whère your going your still directed down either isle.  Youll find in coach a pillow and washed and warpped blanket in each seat.  The in flt entertainment doesnt start until push back from the gate. However the touch screen in front of me was a bit hard to use while seaching from movies and other things which made it annoying.  After take off youll receive an eye mask and slippers to use but, I found it odd the the company still used the two pronged headphone jack.   Haha but they supply you with the hard plastic ones what start to hurt after awhile.  The dinner and breakfast service was pretty good I had the fruit trays but the rest smelled good also.

Took my 1st A321 flight on this plane. I was quite satisfied with the service. the seats in main cabin extra gave me at least 36-37"" of seat pitch, as well as 2"" more recline(6-8"" to be exact). The magazines being moved to a separate pocket above the tray table cleared more space at the knees and the in flight TV's were very cool.

Tickets were very cheap (American Domestic is becoming very aggressive in their pricing). Flown on a very new 2nd Configuration plane, featuring the Boeing Sky Interior, new seats, and a nice IFE + expensive WiFi with good selection. I found the new interior to be well made, functional, intuitive, relaxing, and generally much better and updated than the older 737 NG. However, the seats were a big letdown. They were very stiff, with barely any cushioning unlike the older style. Even though the flight was just ~3 hours, I left the plane with a badly aching back. Recline was poor for row 13 specifically, but forgivable due to location in front of exit row. In addition, the electronics box underneath the seat meant you couldn't keep your legs straight. Distance to the seat in front (I'm 5'8"") was very close. More and more airlines are squeezing as much profit as they can by slimming the seats and compacting them together. IFE and windows were dirty, with some sort of drink staining them. This was partially forgivable on a chaotic Spring Break flight, but not completely. Drinks were served shortly after takeoff, no snacks without charge. Attendants and flight crew were slightly rude, but the gate staff were very pleasant and understanding. Generally, the experience wasn't the best, mostly because of the rock hard seat backing (like most lower cost carriers) but I've seen much worse and I am appreciative for their basic services and amenities (like cleaning the airplane), as well as acceptable standards, when opposed to a carrier like Spirit.By the way, the ""New AA"" is really just them changing their logo and their paint, as well as updating some of their fleet with newer, more cramped seating.",-1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0

American has reduced the amount of space in bulkhead on this aircraft and you are much more squished in.
The 'entertainment' is directly above your head, so you might get uncomfortable watching.
I was very lucky that the middle seat stayed empty, so it was quite comfortable. You MUST board first because you will need the overhead storage for your belongings. You can hold a very small bag and maybe your ipad, but the FA's will make sure you are not holding too much. How much is too much varies by FA.  Remember, if you book this seat and B/C are booked in a flight with empty aisle seats further back, that means the travelers are together. You will probably have someone in the middle seat. Also, in a route where there are lots of children (or seasonal) you may have lap or small children next to you. Bulkhead is popular for people with lap children. PS... this aircraft has some new interiors and some retrofitted interiors. IMO, the new planes are much more comfortable than the retrofitted ones.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Had a connecting flight from Boston to Phoenix via Dallas Fort Worth. Sat in seat 6e on both legs of the flight. Seats were great for me as I was traveling alone with just a carry-on. Having the last row of first class is nice as no one behind you pulls on your seat back when they get up. First leg crew allowed all passengers to use the one forward rest room which was annoying especially since one passengers must have used the facility 8 times. Second leg kept the curtain up and did not allow passengers in the forward cabin. Food was OK at best but service was very good. Warm peanut selection on second leg was really nice.

I normally select an aisle seat (in this case 6E) so I don't need to disturb a seat mate on a long flight. The plane was otherwise full, but when the door closed, 6F remained empty and I moved to the window seat. Both seats had limited recline, but no more limited than other seats in the first class cabin. Seats were comfortably wide and legroom more than sufficient for my 5'-9"" frame.

Our CA was friendly and the service was outstanding. The food choices were limited although AA's signature warm nuts and the ice cream served for dessert were first rate.

Seat was a good location.  It's obvious it's a newer plane, but my seat wouldn't recline and my tray table was not level. To the point the attendant was concerned my drink might slide off. The attendant asked if I wanted water, and gave me a napping when I said yes, but then forgot me. The other attendant brought me some an hour later since we were still grounded for being overweight with cargo. Entertainment screen & choices were great. Inflight fruit & yogurt was nice.

Food is not good. You have a chance to pick between turkey sandwich or chicken salad. We asked for one of each and regreted it.

STAY AWAY!!!
This is probably the worst airplane I have flown in 1.8 million miles (that means I have had some really crappy rides).
The aircraft was old, dirty, everything broken and the service was that of a McDonalds!
I sat in an upgraded seat that would only recline a couple of inches due to the bulkhead.  If they had moved the seats forward only a couple of inches I would have had full recline, but no, they don't think like that.
Everything was filthy and crusted with dirt and grime much like a third rate hotel.  There were still used tissues in my seat pocket, the window had what looked to be 5 layers of some woman's hair spray, and the seat was really worn with no remaining padding.
As far as service, it was virtually non existent.  I thinnk so many people were complaining that the flight attnedants did not want to come out other then for the obligatory crappy lunch and beverage service.  Nobody made any attempt to keep the heads mildly clean and things just went down hill from there.
Speaking of food, this may have also been the worst meal ever served on an airliner.  Again, I have flown a lot and have had some really bad food but this topped the list.
Don't look for entertainment on this flight as the overhead system was broken and also make sure that you have a car lighter adapter with you.  you will need this for your electronics as they do not have USB or 110v outlets at the seats.  Only Business and upgraded seats have power 12v power outlets.
Do yourself a favor and fly a different route of airline but avoid this dilapidated, worn out, broken aircraft at all cost.
American Airlines should be embarrassed to fly this plane.

Flew on AA113. Let me sum it up by saying this was probably the worst flight I have ever taken to creole the Atlantic... And believe me, I have crossed it many many times. First of all, my seat, like every other seat in my row had a horrendous black box in front of me that prevented me from stretching my feet... Specially the left one. Second, the temperature in the airplane was incredible low, even after letting the rewarded know that everyone was freezing! My hands, nose and feet were freezing during the entire flight! I had a blanket and a scarf and still that didn't help. The recline was unusually limited... The was along all the economy class seats. The entertainment was also very weak as they only had a few screens hanging from the ceiling for the entire cabin! No personal entertainment whatsoever! Cabin crew were super nice though and the food was pretty ok! If you fly don't ever choose seats H or B as they all have that horrible box in front! Thanks AA for making my flight experience a total disaster! Even Iberia which is probably one of the worst airlines, is miles ahead of these guy! Oh and btw, there are no power ports in economy!

At 6'3"", 30"" of pitch on the middle bank of three seats is unbearable. Find another aircraft if you want to fly American on a long range route. The rows 17 to the back were all in the old cabin style, with the old DC power ports, old overhead bins, old CRT monitors which only occasional worked, and the seats still had ashtrays. Compare this to the forward section of economy where the seats were newer, and had breathable pitch. Service was good from some FA's, but others were downright rude, such as one who refused to speak Spanish with nonenglish speakers, and another who refused to ask passengers which meal they would like and simply randomly distributed them. Lasagne and lactose intolerance don't mix.

This was a flight on an older 767, but one that has been refurbished. The seats are staggered, and if you're flying with someone, you will be separated by a clunky console. The seats don't really lie all the way flat, and I was told I could not keep my bag down under the seat in front of me but had to put it up in the luggage bin overhead. No convenient storage under the seat? Really? Compared to the 747 in business / first, it's not a good cabin arrangement.

The plus side is that this is a very comfortable business seat, essentially the same that is used on the 777 for intercontinental flights, so I was quite happy to get it on a domestic route.  I was quite tired from my early morning connection from Mexico, so it was great to be able to sleep for an hour or so.  On the downside, there is no AVOD.

Main cabin extra on this particular jet with the 3-3-3 configuration is really worth the extra fare.  The seat is wider by at least an inch.

This plane had been equipped with Premium Economy Seating. Though I do not like the idea of Premium Economy I found the seat very comfortable. Slightly wider (1"")  seat cushion however being only 2 abreast by window gave much more shoulder room. Also due to different aisle widths I was not continually kicked and bumped by flight attendants as I was on the return flight with the old layout. Row 16 being an exit row has always had excellent leg room and the new seat really makes the most of it. The leg rest and foot rest may be of value to short people and children but I found it no use at all. The in flight entertainment screen was HD and clear with a large choice of Movies, TV shows, Games, Flight Map choices and a limited choice of Live TV. International feed of CNN and CNBC as well as BBC News. There is a sports channel which claims to show football games but in February post Super Bowl it was full of soccer which was of no interest to me. so very comfortable for day flight. My only complaint is the video monitor when folded down does get in the way of your legs but I guess that will only be for take off, taxi and landing so on a long flight not really an issue. You may need to look at the seat instructions or ask the flight attendant as operating video monitor release and locating the headphone socket, USB and power points is slightly different from other equipment. The powerpoint is standard US 3 Pin Grounded Socket 110v60hz. The headrest unusually for Coach seats actually moved to a comfortable position for a tall pax and stayed there. As I said I do not like the idea of Premium Economy and either fly coach to save expense or First/Business if I need to sleep; that said AA have knocked it out of the park in comparison to the BA, VS Premium Economy seating. Obviously as it was sold as Main Cabin Extra (No Cost to Elites) there were no food upgrades, no amenity kits and no  Bose headphones. As I take my own food on board just in case (non meat eater) Have many AA and other airline Amenity kits from prior flights and my own Bose QC35 ii Headphones, I felt I almost got the full experience. AA FIrst CLass is the roomiest across TATL, the Business product is also the leader with the only seat/bed that is long enough for me to lie down (6'5"") has good food offerings and this Premium Economy product is equally at the top of the TATL league. As NZ and UA remove extra space coach seating and First Class, it is good to see AA upping their game.",2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The business seat was fine. Sitting up, there could have been a bit more support. The buttons used to recline the seat were easy to understand.

These are nice little jets. I paid extra to move up to the exit row (8A) for my trip to Chicago, because my originally assigned seat was in the last row right by the bathroom door. The exit row gives you a bit more leg room (not a lot). The bigger plus is that it is quieter than farther back in the plane. I like to look out the windows when I fly. Interestingly, although you are sitting over the wing in the exit row, your view is not obstructed by the wing. You do have to scrunch down to look out the window. You can see more easily if you are in the aisle seat and have a compatible seat mate who will keep the shade up. Coming back from Chicago I was in seat 12 B.

My son flew with me on his 1st flight, and I was nervous the smaller aircraft would be too ""sensitive"" and we would feel every single bump.

The only downfall was how hard it was for my son to get out of his window seat and climb over me to get to the restroom.

These have the better legroom of the two bulkhead rows in Club Europe.  The overhead lockers are very low so you cannot stand up unless you are in the aisle.  Locker space is restricted owing to crew and catering storage.  The loo is tiny.  Food and beverage is currently free throughout the aircraft.  The (all cold) Club food offering (choice of two mains plus usual snack plate and cheesecake) was OK and at least served on china with metal cutlery.  The service was OK - the crew only gave out crisps with drinks when requested, but only salt and vinegar.  They kept the other flavours for themselves - observed through the edge of the curtain.

Front row of this aircraft and a bit more legroom than the other bulkhead.  This is the only row that has extra legroom so arguably if you can't get these seats, it may not be worth the extra cost to you.  The Club Europe meal offering has improved and you have a dedicated member of crew however few rows are occupied.  The table is less sturdy than the rows behind and although the centre seat is unoccupied with a latch-in table provided to share with 2C, there are rumours that this will be discontinued and the seat just left empty.

The business class on Brussels airlines is excellent.  Pretty standard LH/ Star alliance product.  An almost lie flat thrown seat with the usual sit, lounge and fly position.

Initially a little  concerned having been changed from a PG flight I was encouraged by the punctuality of the aircraft.

The seating was very good, faux leather (I can't believe it was real leather!) with ample leg room and the aircraft was very tidy.

22K is a bulkhead seat with one window at the shoulder. Tray tables are in the armrest, therefore, the armrest between 22J & K is rigid and slightly reduces the seat width. There is more leg room than the standard economy seat, but there is only a pocket for storing items, everything else must be stored in the overhead bins.

A great Aeroplane to ride in. I sat in the Back row on the right side Window.  I had the whole row to myself. The Seat was Very comfortable and even in the Back row it had Full recline. 
Legroom was more than adequate and even with a cabin bag in there it would have been OK. Width-wise, I do not need to worry - I'm not obese. 
 I acquainted myself with the entertainment suite Very quickly ... touch-screen - No remote, very easy to figure out and use. I watched our progress most of the way and what a Treat that is - So much variation. I watched one Pixar Movie. I have my own headset. 
As Always, Cathay Pacific cabin crew are a cut above other Airlines in their Attitude, Dress and Ability. Their Service is Always above and beyond the required standard. 
The Food is Airline food but it is Actually edible, in fact I'd go as far as saying Cuisine Standard. I never ever leave Anything behind on a Cathay flight. The white wine I took with my meal was enjoyable to the 'Having a Second' level. 
The Convenience of Only one flight is Absolutely Wonderful and I just wish that Cathay would give us this Service All year round.

The Aircraft is quite new and had a feature I had not encountered before, the seat was actually comfortable - when Flying for over 10 hours that is a need I have never had met before.  Although I was [by Choice] in the Last row before the bulkhead the seat had Full recline. 
The Screen was All touch with no remote to fumble with, it was easy to use. I only watched one movie and I read my book most of the flight. I have my own earphones. I had the In-flight progress programme on for most of the flight. The Best in-flight programme ever. 
The personal reading light shone where it was supposed to shine.

I am a OneWorld Ruby flyer, a regular flyer of this route, and have flown on the CX 744s many times, this has been the worst seating experience of the lot. First, your map is obsolete, and does not include the new Premium Economy Section from rows 30 to 34. Economy starts at row 39. On July 9, 2014, I sat in 39K, on B-HUG, a B747-467. 39K has only one window, right near the bulk head, there is no window after that until 41K. The seats are narrower than usual because the bulkhead seat has the folding trays in the armrests, therefore, the armrest is bulkier than the standard economy class armrest. The leg room was great, a foot stool or leg rest would have been awesome! The entertainment screen is affixed to the bulkhead in front of you, but is the same size as the entertainment screens on the rear of seats. This makes the image a bit small if you are sitting back in your seat. The remote did not work, fortunately, the screens are touchscreen technology, so I was able to view the entertainment. What I was not able to do was turn on the overhead light or call for a flight attendant. If I wanted to play a video game, I was out of luck. I realize CX is retiring their B747-400 fleet, but that should not diminish the quality of the flying experience for their passengers, especially since there does not appear to be any reduction in fares for flying on that type of aircraft. The CX B747 also uses the 'shell"" type seat in economy, and normally, this is a horrible way to fly. However, at the bulkhead, the shell seat was comfortable enough after I tucked a pillow behind my back to add some support.",2.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Air Transat does squeeze an extra row or two into the same plane as other airlines use, and they have gone the extra step now by removing the two middle restrooms at row 34 or so.  Those are now more seats.  And less restroom, so the queue can be long and extend down the aisle.  That was bothersome for me being in an aisle seat with people regularly standing on top of me.

I flew first time on this air transat flight to Vancouver and the seat was great! Yes it's by the toilets but the door was over the other side so in this seat I was not disturbed at all and was tucked in the corner by the window! I am only 5.4 so not the tallest but plenty of leg room for me. People talked of narrow seats and I didn't find this a problem either ( I am not petite) with a screen that comes up from the seat. Food was good and sufficient for this airline, as it's a far cheaper price than the national carriers in the U.K. & Canada, so I was amazed to hear people moaning about this. If you want the amount of food and drinks the others give on this route then pay another £400 with another airline.... for a small amount you can order a gourmet meal if so desired, still saving considerably!

I paid to book this seat on my return leg as I was happy with the outbound journey. I will say the service and the aircrew was amazing and nothing was too much for them! I was very pleased with airtransat and will be using again and booking this seat! Can't fault them or the seat! I am a nervous flyer and I was flying on my own but the whole experience from boarding through out was fantastic!

Highly recommended and don't be worried unless your very tall of booking this seat then maybe you want to try the aisle seats of row 12 they had loads of legroom and the seats are sectioned off so people don't walk in front of you! Seriously tall people book these seats :) Maybe one bit of good advice I was given was take some water with you! You can obviously buy this from departures once through security!

We paid 1100 CAD pp RT  to travel last week of July 2016 to Amsterdam. Around this time, the next lowest cost option for a direct flight was about 1400 CAD pp RT. 
Flight departing from YVR left on time but the flight departing from AMS was delayed by 40 minutes (pilot announced that the delay was because of busy airport). Baggage was received in time in both flights. 
Seat width is very narrow. We considered paying for the better seats but there is no point. Emergency seats have slightly more legroom BUT the food tray and entertainment screen are tucked inside the arm rest and underneath the seat respectively. This makes getting in and out of the seat a challenge. Do expect the seats to be worn down or have rips. Since there is no wiggle room, sleeping is not easy at all. 
Decent selection of movies and other options.
if passengers ahead of you recline then your knee will hit the seat. Planes have mood lighting which was softer for the eyes. Flight attendants can be rude to you or grumpy. Not sure how much training they go through to answer your questions and attend you in the politest way possible. 
Food is average - a small sandwich is served which doesn't fill your appetite for a 9-10 hours flight. About 1.5 hours prior to landing, a small snack (pizza slide in both of our flights) with drinks was served. So we def. recommend purchasing a hot meal from the airport for the flight.

Conclusion: it's not a bad flight for the price but if you can pick another airline then don't fly air transat. however, you will be surprised that 70-80% of the plane is filled. they are definitely hitting the sweet spot in price. Also, if your body is wider than average, you might need to request for their widest seat or consider another airline.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I paid CDN$90 to upgrade to this exit row seat and I mostly regret that expense. The window seats (A and K) in these aisles have a large box in front of them which contains a life raft. Unlike your immediate neighbours in B or J, you cannot stretch your feet out much further than can in a normal coach seat. If you are with someone close in B or J, you can push your feet into their space (which is generous), but Transat’s narrow seats make it hard to twist your body for this purpose.

Putting your feet up on the boat box would actually be quite good, but you are told over and over (first on the phone, then in person) that you must not do this.

In addition, in order to have a blanket for this overseas flight, you need to pay an additional $9. That falls below minimum service, IMO. The food was worse than most airline food, and the air hosts seemed utterly unconcerned with their passengers. Two were gabbing over the cart as it passed, and ignored me saying, “Hello!” three times to them, so I didn’t get my drink.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My daughter and I went to Rome on vacation and returned just this week and sat in seats 45 A&C which are the 2x2 seats near the back of the plane.  The seating wasn't too bad for size and I am a larger individual but it was relatively comfortable considering they try to cram as many bodies into airplanes as possible these days.

Even at 5'8"", the Air Transat transatlantic flight seats were terribly cramped. With forward seat reclined, it is claustrophobic. A preponderance of family vacationers make for excited travellers, standing passengers, and a noisy cabin throughout the night.

Travelled back from Toronto on C-GTSD; seating in rear economy cabin is unlike rows 4-30. Legroom is compromised by thickness of seat backs.

The Boeing 737-700 represents the very low-end of AirTransat's fleet.  ""Club class"" is not an offered on this type of aircraft (although ""Option Plus"" is available).
Seat width and pitch are standard throughout this aircraft (narrow in both cases). Tall and/or heavyset people will feel very uncomfortable in the  seats. There are no power port outlets,  and no drop-down/seat-back video screens  on this flight.

Because I choose the ""Option Plus"" upgrade, I was able to choose my seat: exit row, 13A. The advantage of this seat (and its aisle opposite: 13K) is that you have a lot of extra legroom because the seat in front of you has been removed. However, it does get very COLD sitting here, so be sure to bring a blanket or sweater with you. Also, be aware that the  tray table is in the armrest--which makes the seat marginally narrower then the regular  seats. Windows are also misaligned on this aircraft.

All in all, the AirTransat Boeing 737-700  is a no-frills aircraft, and offers very little in the way of comfort or amenities. The 737-700 is beginning to show its age, and should be retired from AirTransat's fleet.",-1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Airtransat has recently expanded its fleet to include the worlds most popular plane. I anticipated a nice interior as they have just acquired these planes but was totally disappointed. The seat width and pitch are standard for this style of plane, 189 seats. It was fine. The interior was a disaster. A piece of seat trim on the left side of the seatback for 2a was missing with wires exposed. Also dirty as l got dirt on my left knee pant leg. My head set plug in was also broken with a loose contact causing only 1 ear to work. A large piece of trim for the overhead bin by 2 h was also loose and falling down. The flight entertainment movie also wasnt operating. Now the worst. A broken toilet seat,broken in half on oct 11 flight. I mentioned it to the staff. The same plane home on oct 18. Nothing fixed.

The Air Transat 737-800s we flew in both from Ottawa to Cancun and back were two slightly different versions of the same plane. I am 6' 1"" and the knee room was barely adequate. In the first version, the magazine holder had been cleverly moved up to behind the headrest to provide a fraction more knee room. On the version returning home, the magazine rack was in the usual place, compromising the already severely limited knee room. Our seats had absolutely no recline ability. 
Our flight was delayed by 45 minutes because a computer in the cockpit had crashed. Once it was repaired, the flight data had to be reloaded. 
Overhead storage was very large and easy to access. The cabin was relatively quiet and the lighting was good. Having three washrooms was a bonus. 
In row 12, for some odd reason, there are no windows.  There is no seatback entertainment, but a number of drop down screens so everyone had to watch the same movie.

I flew to Noumea on the QF361 codeshare (actual flight is SB141). The A320 seems to be getting a little old now, as the interior is tired. The economy seat is typical of any A320 I've been on.AirCalin is a full service airline, so you get a full meal service on this 2 hour 50 minute flight. Qantas codeshare passengers are all placed between rows 14 and 20. I would have expected the cabin crew to speak at least some English given they were flying from Sydney, but apparently they did not (other than the CSM who did the announcements).The meal was pasta with chicken and vegetables, a potato and turkey salad, some chocolate cake, a TimTam and a bread roll. You could have red or white wine, whiskey (unknown brand) and soft drink. The chicken and pasta was very untasty. It reminded me of the type of meals you used to get on long haul flights in the 80s and 90s. I didn't bother eating it, knowing once I got to Noumea I could have a nice French meal.Entertainment is drop down screens.If you are flying this route, try to go on one of the days it's operated by Qantas.

Plane is a bit aged (the A320's in the AirCalin fleet are 10+ yrs old) but still a comfortable experience.

It's shocking that a flight that long had no tv screens. We have been travelling around the world and it's our first experience with this.

The plane appeared new compared to the old clunker we took 2 years ago. There was MUCH more legroom and seat width. The seats reclined much further at a better angle and were much softer and more comfortable. NO backache!  They fed us 3 times on the way home and 2 or 3 times on the way there (I can't remember). The food was okay/adequate. I don't expect gourmet food on a plane. It was fine. The service was excellent. Everyone was cheerful and pleasant. There was a drink station set up with an ICE bucket, so you could get your own soft drinks, juice, and water when you wanted it. The entertainment system was pretty good. I found the music to be either to difficult for me to figure out or there just wasn't much to choose from There were plenty of movies and TV shows. The games were outdated.

My Experience of flying Etihad  (Jul 15th, 2018), started with a serious negative impression, when my seat allocation was done by Etihad automatically, and despite my ""Aisle"" seat preference, I was allotted a middle seat from BLR to Abu Dhabi, and a window seat from Abu Dhabi to JFK. When I asked for an aisle seat at the time of checkin, I was shamelessly asked to shell out more money, which I declined.
Having said that, the overall experience from Bangalore to Abu Dhabi was FORGETTABLE to say the least, though the flight experience from Abu Dhabi to JFK was nothing to complain about (except the window seat).
I would specifically want to talk about my flight experience from Bangalore to Abu Dhabi. The cabin crew I met was MOST RUDE that I ever met. They served the mandatory food yes, besides they were just not ready to ask for any drink, leave aside if I needed something beyond that. When I got tired of waiting, I asked them to get me a black coffee, and the crew never returned. After waiting for 40 mins, I asked them again and voilla, the reply was that we were descending, hence not possible. WOWWWWWWWWW. I got agitated enough to tell the lady that if she were to get me my drink at the correct time, it would have been much before we started descending.
The crew made no bones to hide their irritation towards all passengers overall, as I was not the odd person out.
Would not fly ETIHAD if I have any other choice to fly.

After reading some negative comments about Etihad Airways, both staff, service and food, it was with some trepidation , that we booked with Etihad.
The lounge at Heathrow has now gone under a concession, but it was excellent, to my mind better than BA.
Boarding was on time and the seat on the upper deck was fine, amenities were OK, not first class.
Pre flight drinks and snacks were fine ,and a menu was produced for lunch, with a good selection, and a choice of times to eat.
Food and wine were first class, and service excellent, so different from some reviews, but I find if you treat cabin staff well they will treat you well !

Booked Etihad Business class to try Etihad for a change - and to specifically to try their new Dreamliner and A380. They changed the plane to older planes on both of our flights (first one was to Dusseldorf via Abu Dhabi from Colombo) - food service lacking on both legs of London to Bangkok. London lounge great, Abu Dhabi lounge way too busy very late at night and early in the morning, couldn't get a shower before boarding time, despite very helpful attendent trying 3 different areas.

I sat in Economy. Plane was new. Entertainment had plenty of options and screen was very responsive. Seat was comfortable and spacious - I prefer to keep my luggage in the seat in front (as I'm short usually can't reach the overhead storage!) - normally this means I have to rest my feet on my bags, but this time I had plenty of space! The headrest was comfortable, much better than most airlines.

A380 very disappointed. Always wanted to travel on one with Etihad. Take off and landing was amazing bit that was all.
Flight crew on the way out were verging on rude, condescending and very aloof. Food was pretty awful, hot drinks were luke warm and pretty unpalatable.

Overall I rate this flight as pretty good.  By the end of it I fealt like I had  made a number of new friends (The Cabin crew!)  Around about 3am a number of passengers were stretching their legs & talking in the rear area D.  One of the cabin crew kept offering us some great snacks & it felt like we were having a party! Having said that tho, their are still some things that could be improved on:- 1. the wait for drink & food at the start of the flight for food & drink was quite long.  We took off at about 8.30pm & around about 10.30 were eating a full meal.  Because a number of us were from NZ, our bodies were crying out for sleep not food.  Although earplugs, headphones & eye covers were available, the cabin lights were not dimmed until after all the empty plates etc. were collected.  At this point in the 14Hr. flight (total predicted journey time of 34 hr.s) I really started to wonder whether I would be able to cope.  Fortunately I eventually managed to get a short nap & this lifted my spirits somewhat.  In total I probably only slept 1.5 - 2 hr.s on this night flight! I am quite tall & had tried hard to check in 23h 55 min.s (5 min.s after the earliest time at which the process become available) before the flight commenced.  My experience with their website was very frustrating & in fact somewhat scary!! I selected a seat with extra legroom (which was supposed to be available, but when I tried to move to the next screen I receiver an error msg informing me that the seat was not available & to try again.  After a number of repetitions I, in desperation, tried to select my original seat number & this was not available either!!  I then clicked the back arrow to see what seat No, I now had,  The field was blank! so it looked as if all I had achieved (by staying up pretty late to access the service) was to lose my seat allocation!!  The website was giving me false information & my original seat allocation was not changed !!  Why did I even try!!One other thing;-   There were 2 buttons on the side of the seat rest, initially it seemed that the rear 1 allowed me to recline the seat, with some difficulty.   Later on in the flight, it would not budge, even though there was room behind it.  Eventually I mentioned it to a crew member, they were successful in moving it.  It seemed that the front button was the correct one.  IT WOULD BE GOOD IF THIS information was provided in the literature freely available in the brochures in the front or maybe even announced at the end of the safety talk (until the written instructions become available) ",-1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,1.0

I travel annually back home to Chicago from Abu Dhabi. Etihad is the logical and only choice for a nonstop flight. I am a tall guy with a knee problem, therefore, trying to sit in a middle seat is out of the question. Since I frequently travel, it has become a nightmare when I am ready to select a seat. I have tried the exit seat after paying extra (AED600 ea. way), but realized it didn't make a difference if someone is sitting next to you; you are still going to be cramped in the seat. on other trips, I selected seat 52K (paid extra ea. way). I selected this seat because the seat in the Plan appeared to have a ""space"" from the other seat (this is a twin seat row), but to my surprise, the seats were abutted but away from the window, which didn't make any sense to me especially that I paid extra for this not so ""preferred"" seat!
I guess what I am complaining about is the seat width needs to be considered by Etihad especially for long flights such as Chicago; 14hrs outbound and 13.5hrs inbound. My other complaint is the food; since 90% of the passengers are Asians, Etihad should have considerations for those who prefer non-spicy food. In addition, if you choose to sit in the rear by the aisle, it is going to be a bothersome people bumping onto you, service carts and the worse; people queuing waiting to go to restroom especially after meals!",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The flight was very good in all aspects. The cabin crew were all courteous from the moment we boarded to deplaning. My meals were served hot and was tasty however the sandwich served was very dry I was not impressed. They served water throughout the flight and also had snacks. There was a selection of movies and shows. Although my seat was the last row in the first cabin I was pleasantly surprised it reclined and how much it reclined.There is sufficient legroom for me but if you are taller there would be an issue. The seat width is comparable to other airlines.

This flight/seat was a travesty.13 hrs of having every person and or cart hit and sometimes smash into my shoulder meant that if I never fly this airline again it will be too soon.I felt sorry for the flight attendants who have to try and navigate the carts down the isles that have been restricted due to the 3-4-3 layout as opposed to most airlines using the logical 3-3-3.

I would have expected more comfortable, lumbar-supported seats for a  13hr flight. The legroom was barely adequate; once  under-seat hand luggage was stowed, there was little room between it and the metal seat support for both feet. The food served, while hot and frequent, was primarily of Indian cuisine with no other option if this is not to your liking. I subsequently bought a chicken salad roll at Abu Dhabi airport and took it for my main meal on the return trip. The flight stewards were not friendly at all. Little information was given as regards meal content, and the passenger sitting on the aisle was frequently banged-into by the trolleys, with no acknowledgement or apology from staff. Drink variety was good, however there was no option of fresh fruit with meals. In-flight announcements were often spoken too quickly or too quietly, or  (in the case of English announcements) with a heavy accent, making it difficult to know what was said.

A bad flight.
First of all the plane is unbearably loud. I measured 106 dB Leq. In a normal working environment this wouldn't be allowed.
Row 6 is next to the propellers which makes it even worse (if possible).
The second problem was the cabin temperature. It was unbearably warm during boarding and taxing. The reason for this is that they use only one engine and the compressor is off. Maximum discomfort. When I asked to the stewardess to do something, she didn't even reply. Quite unprofessional.
Finally the cabin was dirty. I was the first one to use the toilet and you can see in the picture how I found it.
I promised myself never to board a Dash( ever again, especially with Eurowings. I used in the past with AirBaltic and the situation wasn't this tragic.",-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0

Seat just in front of the wingtips, right next to the mighty turboprop engines. Window seats have reduced outer legroom due to curvature of the cabin, but OK for me at 5'10"". Pretty much no room for cabin baggage, anything 'larger' will be loaded and returned to you after the flight. Plan ahead if you want you valuable or sensitive items with you in the cabin.

I'm a turboprop fan (no pun intended) but the Dash 8 is awfully loud. I measured an average of 96 dB SPL. Enough to force you to shout if you want to have a conversation with your neighbor.

Service is smiling and friendly.  Business class was less than half full so it was extra pleasant. 
The blankets they provide are an almost full twin-size comforter.  Long enough and a nice weight.  Amenity kit had toothbrush, earplugs, sleep mask and socks.

The welcome drink was good, they offer plenty of bottled Fiji water throughout the flight.

The seat is all automatically controlled with buttons in the armrest.  The seat lowers and moves within a shell so there is no impact to anyone else around you from your seat being down.  There are a million ways to lower or recline the seat but in the most ""flat"" position, the leg rest rises from the seat and fills the foot well in front of you.  It is not flat and at times I felt like I was sliding down, but near the end of the flight I realized there was a foot rest I could have popped out  to prevent sliding.  There is plenty of leg room and you are not permitted to stow bags under the seat in front of you during takeoff and landing so empty what you need into all the storage cubbies available.

The TV is controlled by a remote control in the armrest.  VERY fast compared to Air Canada's touch screen system.

I'd avoid the first row of Business as you have the lights from the galley and noise from the galley.

Drink good.
Food nice but I expected better.
I wanted a certain dish that was offered on the menu to be told "" We only have 2 of them"". So didnt get it.
Staff were not overly happy.
Was surprised that when we went to land there was still food not picked up and they didnt even check if we had our seat belts on!
I looked up and they were putting their seat belt on!
We had a glass break near my 8 year old who knocked it of whilst sleeping and it broke. It was sitting there most of the flight.

This is NOT the plane we would have expected booking through TUI. Very upset that although we had 2 special assistance booked we had no help before boarding, even when requested! The family was completely split up with the 2 SA's people given seats in row 28!  We did explain this when the seats were allocated at check in and was told to ""take it up with your agent"" The others were in rows 12 and 1. Disgusting! Generally the plane is dated. There was no food or drink choice brochures in the seat back and didn't know you could request one.  No hot food on board and rolls were dry. Seat was ok, average leg room for economy. 3 items we asked for from duty free were not available, so didn't buy anything. Cabin crew were efficient, although the curtain was drawn for far too long therefore blocking the front toilet. In a nutshell: Disappointing, upsetting flight which seemed a lot longer than it should have been as no family members nearby to talk to. Disappointed with the level of help for special assistance I.e None. Check in staff were offhand. Standard of food and duty free was bad.

I fly often and all airlines 6ft 210lbs.  I like Frontier but if your rich, probably better to fly other airlines.  I accept that Frontier is delayed more than others, no magazines, just water served and seats have less cushion so bring a pillow to sit on if you have a boney butt. (I don't need one)  For the A321,  Almost all seats are OK.  Best seats for tall people over 5'10"" are rows 2, 3 and all exit rows, any seat except for 13A and 27F which is still better but has the attendants jump seat  in front of you.  Only problem with 27A and 27F is the tiny round window on the exit door.   Exit seats have dividers which I like to keep people squeezing you out of your seat.  Plenty of width for me, but if you have extremely wide hips, you should choose another airline.  These exit seats all fully recline, which almost all seats on frontier don't recline.  Only problem with exits are the flimsy pull out table.    10E and 26B is a little better because no seat next to you so you can still stretch out sideways.  Worst seats are probably 10B and 26E since attendant jump seat next to you takes up all room so very cramped and no window.   Also rows 40 and 41 are stinky when bathroom door is opened.  Row 1 is really no more room than others since the bulkhead takes up floorspace.",-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0

Travelled with my 15 year old granddaughter on 7th April on Jetstar Dreamliner from Sydney to Honolulu.  Nine and a half hours of misery.  Paid extra for upfront seats assuming families with kids would not pay the extra.  Wrong!   Baby of about 12 months was in the row in front and yelled hysterically on and off throughout the entire night.  It's two sibling joined in about 4am and squealed and talked and laughed for the rest of the trip.  Scoot does not allow babies and young children in it's quiet zone up front - Jetstar should do the same.
The journey was not comfortable because the seats were too narrow and not enough room between the rows.  We felt very restricted.

When I purchased my tickets, I specifically asked the Northwest Airlines ticket agent for an exit row seat when I went to retrieve my tickets and passes. Of course, I flew this flight long before airlines started asking customers to pay for exit-row seats. I flew in this same seat round trip between Los Angeles and Schiphol and while most people aren't too happy with having an emergency exit with a very bulky box within their leg space, the flight attendants didn't mind my using the door as a foot rest, since I am a broad-shouldered 6'-4"" tall and there was NO place for me to put my long legs without bothering my neighbor. Considering the tray table is in the armrest, which makes this seat a tad smaller than I like, it was still a comfortable place to sit on a crowded flight of 9.5 and 10.5 hours each way.While I flew aboard this aircraft twelve years ago in 2003, I still remember the fabulous service! Every time I thought I was getting thirsty or hungry, the flight attendants were coming by with trays of water, orange juice, very hot towels, meals, or snacks. The meals weren't terrible, I was pleasantly surprised to have dinner and breakfast on both legs of my trip. Of course, being one of the first passengers off the plane isn't too shabby. One of the boarding doors is directly across from this seat at both Los Angeles AND Schiphol.The entertainment could have been better, but only because passengers were constantly congregating in front of the lavatories blocking my view of the one screen the six of us in rows 21- and 22-HJK were viewing. The galleys are rather close, but KLM's flight attendants are VERY conscientious about working quietly and not disturbing nearby passengers most of whom were sleeping.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

My one downfall with this seat is that you do not have your own airflow control or area to stow your bag overhead, so if you get hot easily on flights or mind putting your bag in a bin across from your seat, I would reconsider this one. The service was wonderful, the food tasted good, and you got to deplane before the general passengers through exiting through the kitchen. Our entertainment system stopped working for about 30 minutes, but they fixed that. One of the bathrooms was out of order for about an hour or two too for our section of business class, but they fixed that too.",0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Aside from the fact that my much hated boss was sitting three rows ahead of me, this was a pleasant flight. I sat on the upper deck outwards and on the lower deck return.

4A is a standard KLM business class seat but being a single seat it offers indeed a lot of space and privacy.  Without the proximity of any toilets or gantries if also is a very quite area.

I saw all the reviews beforehand about the lack of service, seat comfort etc. and found this to NOT be true for us on this flight.  The extra room seats costing $100.00 more per seat while a joke in price is so worth the extra money for that long a flight.  I wish ALL airlines could go back to the more comfortable seating, for this flight we paid it and were thankful.  The service was very, very good and very attentive without being pushy.  We flew over to Europe in regular coach on American and KLM is such a much better way to fly.  I will definitely consider KLM again as they were notthe way the many reviews before we flew were talking about...at least for this flight.

I had not travelled in charter class seating (now incredibly being sold to scheduled customers) this mean and uncomfortable since I had travelled on Britannia 767-200 configured with either 9 or 10 seats across many years earlier.The aircraft had no screens or flight entertainment and the aircraft was so well used that all the lighting units down the side of the plane had visibly extremely yellowed covers.Monarch needs to make up its mind whether it wants to be a high class scheduled carrier or a cheap and crappy carrier with worse cabin conditions than even Easyjet or Ryanair.",-1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I don't seem to be alone in my disgust at the Monarch airways service delivery. Our departure was delayed for some hours due to mechanical failure (I hear - no-one had the coutrtesy to explain). Once they had cramed 352 people into the tiny seats, they brought aboard a deortee with six officials - which was a most unpleasant and disconcerting matter for all - not least the pilot (sounding very ruffled) and the cabin staff.  When they finally removed him, to avoid a brooding riot by some of the passangers - we started our six hour flight at about the time we were supposed to have arrived. The cabin staff wheeled the trollys back and forth with no concern for arms or legs - and my right shoulder was quite bruised by their actions by the end of our jounrney - the food was inedible but there was little chance of eating or drinking when hlding your right arm across your chest to avoid being hit by a trolly. I am writing to our Gambia Experience to tell them that I would galdly holiday with them agin - but would not  again travel with Monarch.

Paid the extra to travel premium. What a let down! First advised 4 weeks before travel that plane would be downsized and have to stop at Kuwait to refuel. This plane is 22 years old and it shows in its cramped, antequated surroundings with no in seat entertainment. It was due to be replaced by 787 dreamliners but the order was cancelled Sep 2011. Presumably becuase they're making losses. Monarchs Chairman stated Nov 2011 that the company strategy will now be on short / medium haul flights. So expect Monarch to change into a ""pack em in"" pay for everything airline! Which it certainly felt like on our flight. Despite complaining to Monarch about our flight change, they merely stated that it was done for operational reasons which is allowed in their T&C;'s!...with no compensation.ps to address other reviewers comments about this plane, it would appear that the normal seat pattern is 3,3,3 but to be able to provide a premium service when they want to, they change the seat plan up front to 2,4,2 x 6 rows.

I have never sat in any aircraft seat so uncomfortably narrow.

Seat had good legroom. However the width of the seat is very minimal.  This restricts movement and impacts greatly on any level of comfort.

I'm a Monarch fan I must admit and fly with them at least three times per year. As usual the flight didn't disappoint. We choose to to pay for the extra legroom seats in the first six rows. The plane was one that Monarch had fitted new seats. These are lighter and roomier.  They do not recline (hooray!) and they have a holder for a tablet in the seat back of the seat in front. Great idea. We never have the meals along with s lot of other people, but they do a good range of food on board. Service as always very pleasant and professional.

Rows 26 to 37 have more legroom than from 10 to 25. I checked myself when I was moved from row 34 to 14 and then back again, and that is a remarkable difference. That seems odd because they are all economy, but for some reason there is more than 2 inches extra legroom on the back set of rows.

My first experience flying Norwegian and the flight was delayed for over two hours!

I had wanted to make claims for tax rebate but due to the long queue at the counter (there was only one person working at the counter) but decided against as I didn't want to miss the flight. If I knew before hand about the delay, I would have had my claims processed.

I had chosen seat 1D which was located next to the galley. The only good thing about this seat is that you get served food and drinks first. 
The leg rest does not offer that much comfort as it does not extend long enough to support the entire length of my leg. I have seen passengers sitting in the row behind me putting the legs on the armrest of the seat next to mine which was empty. Luckly she (yes, it is a she) did not suffer from any fungal issues.

The other guy sitting also on row 2 on my left who have even longer leg did the same thing.!

It is near the toilet and at times there might be crowding which might be a nuisance at times when I was trying to get some sleep. I get fellow passenger asking me to retrack the leg rest for them to cross to the other aisle to reach the other toilet.

The food served was good. I had the pike fish for lunch and half a wrap as a snack midway thru the flight. Breakfast was mushroom with eggs and sausage.

All drinks in-flight was complimentary but I find it odd that snack like nuts need to be purchased even though I was flying with them in the Premium section.

This was not a good flight. Muscat airport  had opened only two days earlier but that is no excuse for the appalling boarding process. The notices on the boards were saying to go to the gate about an hour and a half before the flight. On arrival at the gate there was a very long queue of people and nowhere to sit.  Approximately 20 minutes before the flight was due they started checking people’s paperwork and letting them through. This was not, unfortunately, to the plane but to the waiting area. Prior to getting into the waiting area all hand baggage was again screened  and we had to go through metal detectors. 
We were boarded eventually and then sat on the tarmac for a further hour and a quarter past takeoff time. I had paid extra for a legroom seat, But on the way out discovered that the seat I had bought was just like any other seat. Fortunately the outbound flight was relatively empty and I was able to move. Unfortunately this inbound  flight was nearly full and when I had explained the situation on arrival at the airport was given this seat which I was assured had extra legroom. As I am 6 foot five this is important to me. The new seat was a bulkhead seat.  The  cushion was hard and lumpy.  I could not get comfortable. Service was perfunctory:  announcements were difficult to hear and I never heard a proper  explanation for the delay in takeoff. Finally after takeoff we were given a bread roll and offered a soft drink. Although this was an overnight flight the lights were not turned down until after they had been round with the duty-free and my wife had specially requested them to do this.  Before leaving us alone  The cabin staff gave out some small bottles of water. After I had  tried to sleep for a couple of hours I had to get up and ask the three crewmembers the other side of the bulkhead to stop talking and making so much noise. Unfortunately the seat was so uncomfortable this did not help my sleep.  In the morning staff came round with a menu. This stated that this would be given at the start of the flight and accompanied by a range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. It went on to say that in the morning light snack would be given. With the crew came round with the food no alcoholic drinks were offered and of course if that had been very few people would’ve wanted them. I can only guess, but I assume that the two meals were reversed to save them the hassle of doing a booze round.

 The overall impression was of chaos and cabin staff who had no interest in the welfare of the passengers.  If Oman Air seriously wish to join the ranks of Emirates and Singapore airlines they have a very very long way to go and need to train their staff properly and apply some discipline.",-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0

My first time ever on an Embraer aircraft. Business class seating was very spacious - comfortable seats, amazingly huge amount of leg room and nice big windows. There were two problems higher - water from the AC kept percolating from the vent above which would be enough to make one wet! Also, due to the amazingly big recline, should the person in front of you decide to push the seat back, the touch screen entertainment system too goes down! Dampener.

This was my first time flying with Porter Airlines.  I found the cabin crew professional and courteous. The flight was enjoyable and the landing smooth. The seats are very comfortable and I had plenty of leg room (i am 5' 6""). I am claustrophobic so I found sitting up front on a smaller plane seemed to help. The only setback was the noise from the jet propellers. Noise canceling head phones might of helped. The complementary drinks and snacks were great. I felt like a guest on this airline.

Really comfortable journey in this seat. Fantastic quite aircraft this A380 800 is. Only drawback is closeness to the galley area with the obvious noise problem from crew going about there business, serving up food etc, (slamming of storage cabinets and conversations) not to intrusive but it can wake you if your a light sleeper.

We had 12A&B; on the return journey and there is no comparison particularly with noise level and legroom is longer than row 15 - it was similar to being upstairs in the 747 more like a separate cabin as the first three rows are divided by the galley and toilets.

This was partly because the seat was more narrow than those in the 330 which I had travelled in earlier, meaning  I had to lie on my back all the time. The other difficulty was getting from my seat to the aisle when the person in 22B was asleep. There was no space and I had to step over their bed which was quite a stretch.",1.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

While there is no direct aisle access for this seat, the seat pitch, width and handle on the seatback definitely make it easy to get out from the window seat. There are plenty of storage for the window seat, but lacking for all aisle seats. The screen is small and in an awkward position when you have the tray table out. And when fully reclined, my seat pops up in the lower-back area, making it uncomfortable. So I have to sleep at about 165-170 fully flat (but not lie-flat).

Although a comfortable roomy seat in Premium Economy however any seat that has a seat in front of it poses difficulty in getting out when the seat in front is fully reclined. Therefore it would not be my preferred position on any future trips where I would attempt to gain the front row seats in premium economy. Obviously everyone is on to this now and you need to get in early.

Qatar Airways Flight QR 986
Utapao is only 30 Minutes from Pattaya, quick easy and painless.
Private taxi only 700 Baht
Small and quiet Airport (it was at 7.30 am anyway) Qatar Airways changed the Aircraft for this flight after I booked, from a Dreamliner to an Airbus A319LR Much Smaller aircraft in comparison.
You can only enter to departure area 90 minutes before the flight.
Immigration was very slow with only 1 office in the booth, and he was not the fastest guy in the world !!!
Very small departure area with only a couple of outlets selling very little.
Utapao also has no Business Class Lounge, instead they gave us a $25 voucher to use in Doha Duty Free.
I wanted to buy some cigarettes to take home, but nowhere to buy !!!
Looking around the small area there was a Thailand Duty Free Collection Point, so I assume you can buy this stuff in a different part of the Airport BEFORE you pass Immigration .... Hmmmm this info is not displayed anywhere.
There is no direct boarding facility, so you are bused to the Aircraft (bet that is fun when it is howling down)

Aircraft as I suspected is very basic compared to their Dreamliner with only 8 Business Class Seats

In hindsight I can see why they downgraded the aircraft, it was maybe at 20% capacity, and that is on the A319LR, a Dreamliner would have been empty !!!!!

To be fair both the Aircraft ,service and seats were much better than i anticipated, nice little pods, very close to lie flat seats, Food and Entertainment very good, all in all i was very happy with this flight :)

As for my A380 reviews, probably last one for BUC-DOH leg on Qatar given frequency I fly it unless something terrible pops up!...so few weeks ago flew in 1F, right side business seat window. Was a bit disappointed I lucked out with an old business fit with the club style red padded chairs, not full lie flat. I pay for Business on Qatar because I think there pods are the best and certainly dont pay for the old style club chairs. I think Qatar should recognise this and for Premium members should compensate somehow or sell the seats at a slightly reduced price. Qatar mixes up its A320  and A321 Business seats and its luck of the draw if you get pod or old style. If it is a concern, check with them to try find out which configuration is on the route. Aside from that, still great flight and service as always, two windows for great view and still comfortable...I have another A321 business in a few days...3K...same leg...fingers crossed for pods but dont like my chances.",0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I decided to upgrade to Business from Bucharest to Doha as this flight is often fully booked and is still a 5 hour flight, so arriving fresh for a connecting flight is always good. 1A provided me plenty of room, no obstructions and the pods were the new full lie flat business seat...excellent storage in and around seat and in bins above. Great seat to get in and out quickly as well. Despite being close to the galley, staff always made sure they were conscious of your privacy aqnd kept curtain fully drawn at all times...didn't even notice them.

Flew the A350 for the first time in January 2017, from DOH-ADELAIDE, so nice to relax in business on a 12 hour flight. Service in business always exceptional and my seat 9A is the last in business before economy class curtain divider and on the left hand side window. So absolutely no problems with the business pod itself, the IFE or the to seat service for drinks and food etc. So lets talk any negatives...you board first through front door but then economy boards through door two rows in front of 9A, so you have 10-15 minutes of people going by, but not too bad. Only downside for me with 9A was the curtain behind separating economy being opened and closed all flight, if you are not asleep or deep in a movie, you will notice it, and aside from the few economy girls who kept sneaking in to pinch fruit and chocolates from the centre bar lol, it was ok! A350 business toilets too are for me much better than on the A380, which are smaller and feel cramped. Only other negatives, being kept in perpetual darkness after departing DOHA to adjust to the sun in the east which comes on quite quickly...I don't like cabin darkness when it is light outside, thats what eye shades are for for those who want dark.

This was the first time that I flew in the A350-900. The cabin was clean and gave the impression of spaciousness. The flight was smooth and with relatively low noise. The pressurization system worked very well with little problems with ear pressure. Cabin crew were attentive and the food was well presented. I did not like the salt and pepper grinders which I found too small for me to effectively grip and twist. Of more concern was the positioning of the food tray which extended to a point about 40cm away from me. This meant having to lean forward in the seat in order to eat. Eventually I tired of this and placed a folded blanket behind my back. But, overall an enjoyable flight.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Very comfortable seat as usual with Qatar Airways. It was a little disconcerting at first to be seated facing backwards but you soon adjust to this.

I have flown this aircraft three times, once in Business, SYD-LON and then economy SYD-DOHA. The aircraft itself and Qatar service always immaculate and the cabin crew maintain attention to detail throughout flight. Ok so...business seat first 22A. This seat is left hand side, last row of business before the sky lounge area. Some people complain too close to the curtain separating the lounge and next to the toilets. For me was perfect, next to the lounge lol and next to a toilet !!..noise etc not an issue. The business pods are the best..full lie flat, range of controls and Qatar business service is 5 Star...so for me actually a good seat, well placed as I could get out of seat and wander directly into the lounge for a beer....ok economy I have been in 80D and 73A. Start with 73A...left hand side window with galley wall behind seat...means u lose a little in recline but not much, still goes back a fair way. Proximity to galley means you get cabin staff serving you first ahead of the service trolleys...bonus! Also I like long flights with nobody behind me, especially those who feel the need to continually thump on the touch screen behind your head while playing a game!..so for me I had no disturbance...galley noise not an issue as hardly any and leg room was fine...onto 80D...aisle seat on left hand side of the four seats in the middle...toward the back of plane...leg room unobstructed and ample...bonus is that simply hop out and close to the toilet and the rear door area where you can stretch legs on a long flight...downside...last to get served food and as I found, you will probably miss your choice of what you want to eat...little tip ..the outer armrests can be swivelled up by pushing in a tricky little lever where armrest joins seat, makes getting in and out so much easier...overall no complaints though for A380 or Qatar, they are my airline of choice...also flew the Qatar A350 business...amazing plane and service again hard to beat.",2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0

Back again to review another seat on my 6th flight on a Qatar A380. This time I was automatically seated in the upper deck economy cabin to the rear of the plane, normally reserved for Privilege Club and One World travellers. Seat was left hand window before galley bulkhead. So the cons...window had good view of wing and flap operation which I like to watch...nobody behind me so no pushing IFE all the way...was uninterupted and easy to get in and out...served food first always as it was close to galley...window bins to place items in, very handy and overall more personalised service almost like Premium Economy as smaller cabin. The cons...two seats abreast so trying to sleep or stretch out unless you are 4 foot tall or a contortionist is not possible...cabin I think is substantially noisier than lower deck as you are at the end of the fuselage and receiving the noise from four engines plus the wind rushing along the fuselage is just above your head. Could just be me, but I thought very noticeable given I have been in business ahead of the engines as well and was not as loud.

Hi..back again for maybe my last review of this plane with Qatar given the frequency I travel on it. I had to do this one though for anybody thinking of doing Business Class and to say avoid 10K. I am not fussy..never have been being ex military and flying in all manner of things and takes a lot for me to say something, but avoid 10K! The one plus is probably getting off first thats it, the rest is downhill.  It is in very close proximity to the toilets and galley and the frenetic pace of service and continual in and out and drawing of galley curtains is very noticeable then add the people in and out of toilet; was just non stop. The worst thing though, when looking at your IFE screen, there is a horizontal very bright light in the second galley section right in line with your eyes. I had to keep moving head to the right avoid it as galley curtain not always drawn properly. As in previous reviews, I prefer rear section of Business, quieter and closer to lounge. Service though, exceptional, the hostess I had this time was superb, hats off to her.

Thank you for a very comfortable flight. This was my first time flying on my own, your staff were excellent, nothing was too much trouble. I had booked to be met at Doha and to be assisted with getting to my connected flight. Your young lady was so helpful taking all the stress off me. I would highly recommend this service.  The food was good with a nice menu to choose from. Liquid refreshment was plentiful with a wide choice to choose from. My only complaint would be the lack of toilets. It would be good if there could be a separate wash room for people who want to shave, apply makeup etc. You know you are in for a long wait when you see people waiting and they have their large toilet bags with them.

I had booked business class for this trip to the UK but was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to first class on checking in and I didn't even ask for it.  Seat 1A is the very first seat on the top deck of the A380 on the left hand side of the aircraft. The bathroom is just through a curtain and is seriously the largest bathroom I have ever encountered on any aircraft. The facilities overall were faultless and the a la carte menu to die for. Easily the most comfortable and widest seat I've come across in the sky. The entertainment system has so much choice it would take half a lifetime to watch all of it. The only criticism I could make is that the hand held control was very slow to respond and the touch screen too far away to use but hey, that just goes to show how much space you get in this luxurious seat! 5 stars all round.",0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The flight is Brutal mot comfortable as all the seating is not suitable for disabled people without any exception. The arm rest is indeed not sufficiently functional to work in any health and safety manner which would cause delays in a emergency.   Restrictions immediately need to be done with no delay. The reclining of the seats are poor and could cause serious head injury to passengers at the rear of the reclining movement. In fact I was verbally abused by a passanger due to this happening. I would hope my return journey by the A380 on the 19th January 2028 would get me upgraded to business class.

The on board crew are fantastic. But prior to the flight it is IMPOSSIBLE to get anyone on the phone. No one answers. And their email service is a joke.

First time flying to Oz on my own. Had been stressing about it
for weeks. Shouldn’t have, all of the staff are excellent, cannot do enough for you. I was met at Doha to be escorted to the Sydney link, she was a lovely girl, so helpful and caring, just what I expected. Definitely must book for this on my return in April. Was very pleasantly surprised how good the food was, hot with plenty of choice and plenty of it. I was pleased with my choice of seats which I prebooked in January.

This was my first flight with Qatar and it won't be the last. The staff were friendly, attentive and faultless. The seat was comfortable and spacious for me. The only disappointment was the main course. The lamb was so tough I couldn't even cut it. I noticed another passenger with the same issue. All other food was great. The staff offered other options (which I didn't take) and they were most apologetic.  Toilets could probably have done with a more detailed clean before the flight as handles felts sticky. They were regularly serviced throughout the flight so I think it was a ground crew issue. All in all.

Quite a few seats were difficult to recline/straighten. I broke a thumbnail because I had to lift out of my seat and press the button with BOTH my thumbnails before the flight attendant had to push it from behind...other passengers had the same problem.

Seat was comfortable seat width & recline was very reasonable and there seemed to be more legroom than many another airline I've flown on - a very pleasant and comfortable experience..........only short coming was that the arm rests do not fully push back flush with the seat backs when one needs to convert the 3 seats into a 'bed'.

Ok so I fly Qatar where I can all the time and fly them a fair bit in last two years. I tried this flight deliberately as it was a 777 and have mainly flown A380 and A350 with Qatar and also to get a morning arrival in Sydney. 
I don't often get disappointed with Qatar but this time got annoyed with check in information. When I checked in at Bucharest on my first leg I asked if anyone was next to me on the second leg as I am a big guy, they said no, seats were blocked. I thought great. Got on board window left hand side economy, 17A and find that I do get two people next to me. I said to stewardess could she do something and she apologised and asked cabin manager and they said the front row in the middle of cabin just behind business class dividers was free. I said thanks and moved to 10E aisle seat just behind business class. Seat was excellent for legroom as you can stretch legs right out and also stand easily to stretch if need be. Service was excellent at front of economy getting everything first in that seat and short walk to toilets behind. Only thing is it is a baby row and you may get a young baby who cries all the way. Only problem was this row has the IFE screen in the seat armrest and it folds out and up and doesn't quite sit at the right angle and screen very old and dull.

Rest as usual is exceptional, with the attention to detail from cabin staff spot on. The 777 for me though seems a little old and tired, maybe I just prefer Airbus planes.",2.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Incontestablement, il existe une très grande différence de confort entre l'aménagment de l'A340-600 et celui du 777 300-ER.

With the new Q-suite it didn't matter at all that this was a rear facing seat.  I flew with my wife (seat 3F) and we could have had a double bed made up ... had I not fallen asleep so easily.

The suite provides space, a really comfortable seat that transforms to a fully lie flat bed, a lot of personal storage, good charging options for lap-top and phones and a large HDD screen.  Overall the best business class package I have seen.

This comment covers both an Airbus and Boeing as two flights were taken from SIN to JNB.
Having flown extensively on the African continent and one in the Pacific the comfort and service received on Qatar  is far superior to any other carrier used,

Ok so I flew Business Class on 2 December 2018 from Sydney to Doha and deliberately booked on the 777-300 ER, not my normal choice of aircraft, as I prefer the A380 for long haul, but I was desperate to try the Qsuite, which is yet to be fitted to the A380. Its a pity that the map here does not reflect the new Qsuite layout and still has the old configuration. I messaged Seat Maestro pointing this out but no reply and map still old, but  I will review anyway. Most of Qatars fleet of 777-300ER and 777-200LR have been fitted, but check seat maps and ask if you want to try it because it is definitely worth it; better than some First Class products.

Essentially Qsuite has a 1 - 2 - 1 configuration with 48 suites in Business Class. Rows 1-6 are ahead of the front exit and rows 7 to 11 are behind the second entrance/exit door, so if you are in 1-6 you board separately and dont get disturbed, in 1-11 you still board first but then have all economy boarding through the door ahead of you and coming past. Until take off your sliding door to the suite is locked in the open position. I was in 11B which is a window, left hand side and last row before economy class curtain divider. First the pod or suite itself. Simply outstanding, it really is like your own small room with ample bench space, large fold out table with several adjustments. One thing they got right now is the seat pitch, old business you always sat too high and slightly reclined which felt awkward and lifted your feet off the ground, this is flat and straight backed now. One thing I really liked is the seat now doesn't have a leg extender that raises you feet off the ground, instead the seat slides forward or backward to bring your legs closer to the feet rest. The leg extender always left your legs at an odd angle and still hanging down so no good for DVT on long flights. One thing I  wont say I disliked but was a bit annoying, the main storage bin to the left under a cushion is well tucked away but a bit fiddly trying to get the lid open and closed. Then if you have stuff on top of the cushion and want to get into the bin, you have to move it all and the lid gets caught on the seat belt unless you lift it out of the way. But aside from that very comfortable and like a little oasis, especially with the sliding door that fully seals you in. 
The seat position itself in 11B, great view of the engine and wing leading edge and despite being near the economy divider curtain, it was ok, didn't notice anything. If you are one of these people though who really prefers no disturbance of curtain being drawn and closed or a family maybe behind you in economy with a young child, then get a seat further forward. The Qsuite though is outstanding and so much better than the old business pods which were still a great product, but now you sit lower and are enclosed and feel very private as you dont see everyone else now, the old seats you sat up very high and could see everyone. I only marked entertainment down slightly as the World Map on this flight was a version with less control than normal. 
Service as always impeccable on Qatar and staff exceptional in Business, but that has always been my experience in economy as well with them.

This QATAR flight uses a LATAM A350 in 2-2-2 configuration.  The aircraft can’t cope with that layout on long flights.  This is in contrast to the 1-2-1 displayed when I checked in and booked my seat - something rather odd here that the aircraft configuration offered on checking in just a few hours earlier doesn’t match the a350 I thought I was checking in for. 
It’s a bloody awful layout as the beds are so wide at the foot to need to twist you ankle to get your food between the seats to get our, or in the end you just stand on the seat and lead over your sleeping Neighbour. 
Food was fine but you think the staff are goin to drop everything in your lap as the lean over to try to serve you.  Avoid window seats in this LATAM aircraft.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

A well designed business class area. Good, friendly staff. Comfortable seating, with full reclining bed a real bonus. Entertainment system OK, although routing on handheld device a bit quirky. Choice of films and music reasonable. although more under ""classic"" heading would have been welcome. Food and beverages very good. Good selection of wines, but from a personal standpoint would have welcomed a slightly larger range of whiskies (my own preference is for Islay malts). Only main issue on this flight (and not on the return journey from Doha to London on 2 April) was a group of passengers mingling in the open area behind row 5 who were drinking more than other business class passengers and were becoming louder as the flight progressed. Fortunately it was a daytime flight (2.00pm departure from Gatwick) and the noise reducing headphones proved a real blessing in diminishing the sense of intrusion, but some passengers were trying to sleep and the noise was detrimental to this. Staff tried their best to mitigate the intrusion but the group seemed determined to be noisy.

Economy. Seats are very cramped (width wise, as well as leg-room wise). I am not tall 5-7, and even I had problem. It is also very uncomfortable when the passenger in front of you reclines their seat. Thankfully the flight attendants made sure every one had their seat in upright position when meals were served. Even with that, it was hard to eat. Also it was a struggle to get the seats to a reclining position, and even harder to get them back to upright (it may just have been me).
The service was good: flight attendants were cheerful and attentive.  The food was excellent (at par with and sometimes exceeding that of Emirates). The entertainment system was also good (not as many choices that you get in Emirates, but varied enough). However the cramped seat made me wish I had availed myself of their business class upgrade offer  for this leg of the journey (12.5 hours).",-1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This was our first time flying with Royal Brunei. The plane was operated by the 787 Dreamliner. The seats offered sufficient legroom, and were wide enough for myself personally. Travelling with my fiance, I can say that she had no issues with the seat at all. 
Usually I find Airline food to be rather, dry and bland, but Royal Brunei served some great food. There was a choice of meals, between, Chicken, Beef and Vegetarian. (Being an  airline from an Islamic country, there is no Pork offered.)

A snack was served, followed by a meal. I had chicken with rice, and some of my fiance's shepherds pie, and in all honesty, I would have happily eaten another meal.

Drinks were readily available.

The entertainment system was good, loads of films to choose from, and something for everyone. There were games, films, Popular TV series, documentaries, and music. As the flight to Dubai was 6.5 Hours, there was more than enough to keep myself entertained, although I don't know if this is the case for passengers travelling beyond Dubai, on to Brunei.

The staff were very pilot, friendly, and quick to assist. One thing I forgot to mention, was my screen crashed, so I had to use my fiance's in flight entertainment system to call a member of crew over. 
However, they reboot my screen and I was soon watching a film again. 
Our return flight was delayed by 3 Hours due to a technical fault, but the crew kept us informed. Royal Brunei handed us vouchers to visit a good few of food joints at Dubai terminal one. Despite the flight departing late, the staff remained professional, friendly and were quick to assist us. 
Breakfast was served two hours before arriving into LHR. There was a choice of two meals, although I can't recall what they were, nor did I myself eat. My fiance wanted to choose her meal, but due to popular demand, the meal she wanted was no longer available.

All in all, despite a few hiccups, which I can't say were major, it was a great flight, with great staff, and I'd happily book with Royal Brunei again.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Trångt i stolarna, Trångt för benen (är 1,89 lång) Flygning mellan Arlanda och Aqaba  5 tim. ingen mat serverades, inte ens de smörgåsar som utlovats, endast DYRA småkakor  läsk och alkohol i olika varianter. Hemvägen serverades dock sandwich, men 8 och 10 jod för en liten macka är ordentligt i överkant på ett flyg. Faktiskt en av de sämre av alla flygningar vi gjort .

This airline is a business, businesses are meant to make money - it's called 'profit' - and if they don't make one they go bust and nobody gets the chance to fly at these extremely low prices. If everyone just paid for their flight and nothing else the profits would be so low it wouldn't be worth Ryanair carrying on.  It's a Budget Airline, it's never claimed to be anything else and if Budget is not what you want then you don't have to fly Ryanair, it's a free market so fly with another airline - you won't be missed. The profits are made with the extras and add-ons that are available but you don't have to buy them. You'll get what you paid (next to nothing ) for - a seat.  Ryanair isn't a charity or one of the caring professions so why expect charity from them and for them to care about your whining crying children, they're your children and you know children cry so put your hand in your pocket and pay that bit extra for your children to have less to cry about. It's not the airlines problem - or the other passengers. If you're 5' 2"" tall then you know you're 5' 2"" tall and probably have know it for a while so why moan that your height, or lack of it, is a problem because of the seat - that you paid for and wouldn't pay a few £ extra to choose another - is somewhere you don't like and you can't lift your bag up to the locker. Unbelievable! Grow up and join the real world. Petty annoyances like this are pathetic - you couldn't reach the locker so had to ask another passenger - what on earth will you do if you ever have a real problem. I hope above all else I'm never on a flight with the whining moaning people who've reviewed this airline - and now the whole world can see how ridiculous you are. Ryanair has a 100% safety record, not a single fatality since it first started. 400+ million passengers and never lost a one - Quantas can't say that. The 'safest airline' has had lots of fatal aircrashes. I'm grateful for Ryanair and while I would never say it's enjoyable flying with them it could be a lot worse and a lot more expensive. Thanks to Ryanair dozens - hundreds - probably thousands - more people have been able to have better holidays and more of them. Stop looking for faults and life will be a lot more pleasant and run a lot more smoothly no matter which f*ck*ng seat you're sat on. My son was Ryan, I'd never fly with any other airline now. From every window Ryan is with me all the way wherever I go. Moaners who can't reach the lockers and whingers who can't sit next to their friend for 2.5 hours (yaaawn) and parents who'd rather have the money instead of a bit of comfort for their children but think they should have what everyone else pays for because their children aren't happy - there are people who'd love it - absolutely love it - if that was the only problem they had. Have they never heard that you get what you pay for, or do they think it's not meant to apply to them.

This was our return flight. The seat did not recline - it was broken.The flight attendant tried to fix it and it was okay for a couple of hours and then did not work again. This was unfortunate as the seat is the only thing on this flight that made it even feel like business class. I will never fly business class again with SATA. Other than the seat I saw nothing that would make it different from economy class so no point in spending your hard earned cash. It is old style seat equipment for the entertainment. Only 4 (and they were not new ones) vides to watch which were the same 4 were were given for our Toronto-Lisbon leg. They had no rum. Had only a couple of bottles of wine (which they ran out of) and they used the same plastic glasses as economy! For exiting and entering the plan all business class line up in the lines with everyone else - there is nothing and I mean nothing other than than the seat reclines (when it works) into a bed that distinguishes business class from economy class.

Azores Airlines A330-200.

Echoing other reviews: The ""Executive"" class in Sata / Azores airlines consists mostly of a larger, fully reclinable seat with more personal space. There is free wine, an upgraded meal (based upon conversations with our friends in Economy), and business lounge access before the flight.

So, not fancy. But for me the single, largest draw to business class is the ability to fully recline your seat and sleep on an overnight flight the Europe. And, although the seats and amenities were dated (and broken... but fixable), it most certainly met the mark. Great sleep, and generally good service.

The airplane interior is long overdue for an overhaul/update, but I doubt the finances of the company allow for it. And, with an Executive Class flight between Toronto and Porto costing us only $1,600 CDN ($1,185 USD), their is clearly value in their offering.

Summary: If you want a good night's sleep, and aren't too concerned with being at the cutting edge of amenities and design, SATA's Executive Class is worth considering.",0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I used to fly with other airlines that use the Jeddah North Terminal where it took an average of 3 - 4 hours to clear immigration. A colleague suggested that I try Saudia since the Jeddah South Terminal is less crowded and immigration clearance is much quicker. He was right, I was out in about 45 minutes with my bag.
Legroom was slightly more than other economy cabins, food strictly airline average.

The seat is a standard economy seat on 77W in aft cabin. It is slightly narrower than what I had on A320 from Saudia.

We recently flew SIN/HYD/SIN with Silk Air on this aircraft.  It looked really clean and fresh inside and the seats were comfortable. I will mention here for thos who like exit row seats.  On this aircraft these are normal seats and there is no extra leg room so it is probably a disadvantage rather than ad advantage.For a more budget type airline the crew were very friendly and efficient and the food was quite good.  We were offered juice or water shortly after takeoff and a light meal was served - quite adequate.  I would prefer real milk for coffee and not the powder which is awful, but that is a minor complaint.What really surprised and disappointed me was the lack of on-demand seat back busic, TV, new or even old movies - none of this.  They did play some boring visual (no audio) entertainment from the drop down screens which are located around every 3rd row. Overall I was very impressed.  One member of the cabin crew was trying to be overly efficient and was abrupt to everyone, her manner was rude, especially in comparison to all of the other friendly and thoughtful crew.",0.0,0.0,-1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Having been flying with Silkair for several times,I find that the best seats are those in the very front row of the economy class. The Emergency seats are also as good,however,passengers are not allowed to put their sling bags,or small carry on bags under the seat in front of you. Instead,they must be kept in the cabin baggage storage,making it less pleasant if there is important stuff inside your bags.The worst seat for me is the last row. It's busy and noisy around there due to the toilet,also the staffs.Also,they are not reclinable,and not to mention the newspapers that are put below your seats! I also wonder why they do not play d short movie anymore nowadays,something that they used to do some time ago.The service is overall very good,a typical singapore airlines service,good food,good drinks,good blanket,and the seats are clean either.

I flew MAA-SIN with Silk Air on this aircraft. It was reasonably clean, though there was some sticky residue around my seat pocket and in flight magazine. The seats were typical low cost airline width and leg space was also cramped. The food was quite good. Mixed nuts and soft drinks were served as well, with beer as the only choice of  alcoholic beverage available. The crew were very friendly and efficient . The in flight entertainment was severly limited, with options of either watching the drop down small overhead TV screen which was showing mainly uninteresting documentaries, or their on board wifi for which we needed our own devices to connect. Unfortunately the wifi is not compatible with Windows 10, so I could not access it on my laptop.

We went to Chongqing for a short vacation and the entire inflight experience  was average. The inflight entertainment did not work for IPhone. We tried to play a movie or a documentary film but it didn't happen. We could only listen to music and slept our way through. The FA were not really customer-focused. They tried not to serve drinks in the last 5 rows. We tried o ask for drinks and a female FA said:"" We were serving just now, why you didn't get one?"" It sounded like we were trying to create trouble.  The dinner on board was alright and at least they served hot beverages, unlike our outbound flight.

Always happy flying SQ. My favourite long-haul airline. The seat configuration of 2-4-2 on the A330-300 allows for several different choices when selecting seating: 1. Window seats, where you can lean against the bulkhead and have only one person to annoy when getting up; 2. Aisle seats, where you can get up when you want (or be made to); 3. The four middle seats (when available) to use as a fully flat bed. The fully retractable armrests make this last option enticing! On this particular flight during daylight hours I preferred a seat closer to the front. My travel companion who was of large frame and had a disability sat next to me in 32K. No problems with spillover. Although I doubt you can't avoid this with any airline unless you are in Business Class. On a return leg overnight I had seat 35C and my companion 36C. We thought we were going to have empty seats at the window but it worked out otherwise. A FA told me there was plenty of space at the rear. So after the seat belt sign went off I went looking for more room. There were plenty of empty seats available including several rows of three and a row of four. Suffice to say I didn't bulk at the opportunity. We both sat down. Later on we split up to take other seats to lie down. This is the beauty of the 2-4-2 config and the fully retractable armrests! In general the Economy Class seats on the A330-300 are of good quality. If you find them hard you can always ask the FA to give you an extra blanket or cushion. A couple of points to make to those that have not flown. If you want less engine noise and the effects of turbulence, sit further up in front or over the wing. If you prefer to score a row of three or four to yourself, look at the rear first. Hopefully they’ll be away from toilets where people congregate. Airlines always fill up seats on the wing first for stability reasons. Besides the seats the service was excellent on both sectors. On the first I asked for a hot tea with lemon and honey for my sore throat. The honey was unavailable. A suggestion I'll make to SIA management. Later on I had a cognac in lieu of the honey! The food was of very good standard for Economy Class and the Entertainment the same. Though I tend not to watch anything on the overnight legs preferring to rest. Apart from the unimportant oversight of the honey, I have never been disappointed with SIA and have always complimented the staff for their consistent quality of service, which is prompt, courteous and done with a smile.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Having just flown in from Saigon on the same aircraft type & with the same airline I was confident that I was going to have a good flight.
Wrong! The two flights were like chalk & cheese. By the time I got on board I was quite thirsty. I whispered to the attendant that when we got airborne could she bring me a drink of water ? She said she would & I waited patiently. We took off & I waited,&waited,&waited! Finally I went to the rear galley & found a steward who poured me a cup of water then another. This service was in direct contrast to my experience flying from Saigon to Singapore! On this flight they brought the standard hot towels but neglected to offer any sort of beverage at all after take off. The attendants supplied passengers  with a small bag containing  a toothbrush & pair of socks but no sleeping  mask like in days of old. The lights were dimmed not long into the flight & I had the impression that the crew wanted us all to behave like the good cattle we are & settle down. I wrapped a blanket around my head to keep out the bright light of the exit sign a few rows in front of me & tried to sleep! I had difficulty getting the seat to recline as the button did not seem to release the mechanism but eventually with some leaning on the seat back I got it to recline. With about 2 hours left before we arrived in Perth the crew began serving 'breakfast' which was a choice of omelette or seafood with angel hair noodles! They began serving from the very rear of my section & so when they arrived at my seat my 'choice' was not a choice but an ultimatum. ""Would sir like to try the seafood?"" I had no option other than to accept or go hungry! I was not impressed & all of the good work that this airline does to place itself in the top 10 for service in the industry was destroyed in that moment for me. I had paid nearly $90AUD extra changing flights & selecting seats for my return from Vietnam & I now believe that I was treated quite badly by this crew. I will be taking these issues up with the airline at a later date. Meanwhile on the subject of this model of aircraft, seat 34A & 34K do not have windows next to them but this is not indicated on the Seat Maestro map.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I was booked on a later flight but the check in guy asked if I wanted to change to an earlier one. I asked how much? I thought he said $15 but it turned out to be $50!
I had already paid $21 to select a seat on my later flight so this was a pretty expensive seat in my opinion. The 2_4_2 layout is why I picked Singapore Airlines for my journey.Normally I would try to avoid getting stuck in the middle of the row of 4 seats but I requested an aisle seat before accepting the change to earlier flight. The seat had good legroom & fortunately the 2 other seats were empty which might have been a bonus had it been a night flight. Service was speedy with the hot towels being dispensed whilst we were all seated before take off. Meals & drinks came around as soon as the aircraft reached cruising altitude & I complimented the attendant on her efficiency which she accepted gracefully. This was only a 2 hour flight so they managed to feed all of the passengers within this time. This was the first time that I had flown with Singapore as I usually used Malaysian Airlines but that airline began using 737's on my usual route & when I realised Singapore Airlines used A330-300's I chose to them for the whole sequence of journeys

Very impressed with SQ - the aircraft was clean and fresh.  I really enjoyed the configuration of 2-4-2 on this leg as there was just the 2 of us and no-one else next to us.  On our return leg we had 61DE which was 2-3-2 as the aircraft narrows in the last few rows.  However no problems with seat recline as we were in the 3rd last row and also no problems with queues for toilet etc.Seats were comfortable with good leg room and recline.  The service throughout was excellent - friendly, helpful and efficient at all times.  The food was nice and tasty and of adequate size.  On the return sector (same aircraft type) we had tiramisu icecream and ferrero rocher chocolates so that made for a pleasant experience. In economy on most airlines (except SQ & QF) I find it almost impossible to get a 2nd glass of wine but the service was great and they constantly, and happily, offered a variety of beverages to all passengers.There was a great range of on-demand entertainment from movies (new and old), latest TV shows, documentaries, music etc, so much that I didn't have time to see everything I wanted to watch.",1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

2 flights on this plane in J (Business Class). First from Yangon to Singapore in 14A and second from Singapore to Adelaide in 11K (bulkhead).RGN-SIN flight was full in J and Y, SIN-ADL was 14 in J and full in Y. Service on first flight was alright, polite friendly staff, and very clean plane. 3 choices for lunch, including duck, that i had. Second flight, service was fantastic, they spoke to me by name, and confirmed my book the chef meal, and my glass never seemed to be empty. Seats are wide and comfortable, lots of leg room, especially bulk head, and having the seat next to me empty on the second flight, which was overnight, made it seem all the more spacious.

To be honest I was dreading this flight being Thomas Cook Airlines, an old aircraft and no reclining seats.  However, I must say that since Harriet Green has taken over as Group CEO the improvements to Thomas Cook as a whole are impressive.  Previous TC flights taken can only be described as extremely miserable with the attitude of cabin staff leaving much to be desired.  This flight, what a difference.  The staff did appear to be a little older, oh dear should I have said that? but were extremely friendly, helpful and professional. Each flight left a few minutes late, nothing to worry about, and landed either on time or early.  The food was some of the best I have had on a flight.  Seat 1G going out with a small amount of extra legroom, tray in armrest so width curtailed a little.  Seat 31G on return with a greater amount of legroom and again tray in armrest.  Seat 1G by far the best of the two.

I was a bit skeptical before flying turkish after reading many bad reviews on the forums. However, I would have to say that I am glad I flew. I am a US citizen and took this route as one leg of my trip. I had two kids and my wife with me. The plane is one of the most common that TK uses for its long haul flights alongwith A330. The seats are excellent, with good leg room and recline to 169 degrees. These are not ""flat bed"" seats as TK offers on their 777, however, these ""lie flat"" seats were very comfortable to sit on and also when it was time to sleep I easily was able to sleep very comfortably. I am % ft 6inch and sleep on my side, and even though the seat when flat slopes down, but you can easily adjust the foot rest to support your feet and that would ""tuck"" you well in the seat. The service was excellent, with 6 air hostesses for the 32 business class passengers. They were warm and elcoming. Some of them were not very fluent in english but were able to cater to the needs with out any problem. The food came in one main course, midflight snak (sandwiches) and one ""light meal"" at the end of the flight. The main course was served with an advance menu with passengers name written on the menu cards. Then there were three courses, served in a buffet style, including a choice of appetizers, meal and dessert followed by coffee and brownies. There was alcohol for the passengers, I am not sure what types as I do not drink. I would definitely recommend TK, especially the price we got for our route was half of the other carrier's business class!",2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

This seat is an example of the standard and typical first class seating utilized by United Airlines both domestically within the US and on short-haul international routes. Relatively-speaking, it is an okay seat given the size and type of aircraft (Airbus A320) and on par with that proffered by other airlines utilizing aircraft of similar size domestically. Of course, it is not the same as the lie-flat seat found in business and first class on several of the larger aircraft used domestically by United (e.g. B-757, B-767, B-777 & B-787). Compared to the other seats in first class on this particular aircraft, this seat has the advantage of more personal space because there is only the bulkhead in front of you and thus no seatback that can recline backward into your space (and face). Moreover, as this seat is in the first row, it means you will be among the first passengers to receive inflight services (from the flight attendants) and you'll be among the first few persons off the plane (which can be advantageous if the flight is running late or you have a tight connection). The negatives are: (1) you have no under-seat storage space (because there is no seat in front of you); (2) there is no AV entertainment system; and, (3) you are close to the galley and lavatory. The noise from the galley may be disruptive when in use and you will hear the flushing of the toilet. Additionally, leg room may feel a bit restrictive - particularly if you're a tall person - because there is no under-seat space in front of you in which to place your feet. Also, light emanating from the galley/lavatory area may prove problematic for sleeping during long night flights (when the cabin has otherwise been darkened). Another potential issue of annoyance is the likelihood of overhearing the conversations and banter of the flight attendants who are hanging out in the galley area during lulls in inflight services. I don't begrudge them the right to socialize but, I as a passenger should not be subjected to hearing personal and private discussions and opinions about diverse topics of no interest or relevancy to me. If you do not have any way to ""mute"" or ""tune out"" the unwanted conversation then it may prove annoying to overhear. The problem is that you don't have much choice in the matter because you cannot simply move your seat and there is no AV entertainment system that you can utilize to “drown out” the noise. Obviously, if you have your own entertainment device - use it! This is about all I can say about the seat itself aside from observing that the finish/cover is leather and the cushion is sufficiently supportive and comfortable. Realistically, to some degree, one's perception of how good a seat is will be determined by the level of service and treatment provided by the flight attendants. If you have good service and are treated well - you'll feel more positive about the seat. Conversely, if service is shoddy and you're treated poorly - then you'll feel more negative about things. On my flight service was relatively good. The only other observation I'll mention is that the overhead storage space for our carry-on baggage had been taken over by the luggage of the flight attendants which forced us to find storage space elsewhere nearby (and thus take away storage space intended for other passengers).",-1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0

This is a standard aisle seat located on the right side of the aircraft just a few rows behind the over-wing exit rows. It is one of what I call the ""back-of-the-bus"" seats featuring the new Slimline Recaro seating. In light of the trend by most of the domestic air carriers to squeeze as many seats/rows as possible into their airplanes, the best thing I can say about this seat is that it was adequate in terms of breadth, leg space and comfort. If you are 5' 10"" or less in height, or a somewhat taller person with short legs, you will be able to sit in this seat and still have a couple of inches between your knees and the back of the seat in front of you. In other words, you don't have to sit upright and uptight and feel as though you cannot move or a frozen in place. The lumbar support of the seat back is neither better nor worse than any other typical economy/coach-class seat on United Airlines. I do wish that the seat cushion itself was more supportive - it felt soft and thin - perhaps because the density of the foam, filler or stuffing material used is lacking. On a long flight this seat may become uncomfortable and cause you to squirm a bit or want to get up and move around. Seat recline has been reduced and I was only able to move/tilt the seat back about two inches. Fortunately, for me, the middle seat on this flight was empty and that made my specific seat feel less confining and more bearable as I could spread out a bit (likewise for my seatmate in the adjoining window seat of this row). To reiterate my earlier comment, this seat was adequate and tolerable given the trend by the airlines of reducing seat pitch on their aircraft. Stated simply, it represents the new standard in air travel for the average passenger traveling on a budget.",-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0

Moreover, as this seat is in the first row, it means you will be among the first passengers to receive inflight services (from the flight attendants) and you'll be among the first few persons off the plane (which can be advantageous if the flight is running late or you have a tight connection). The negatives are that you have no under-seat storage space (because there is no seat in front of you) and you are close to the galley and lavatory. The noise from the galley may be disruptive when in use and you will hear the flushing of the toilet. Additionally, leg room may feel a bit restrictive - particularly if you're a tall person - because there is no under-seat space in front of you in which to place your feet. Also, light emanating from the galley/lavatory area may prove problematic for sleeping during long night flights (when the cabin has otherwise been darkened). Another potential issue of annoyance is the likelihood of overhearing the conversations and banter of the flight attendants who are hanging out in the galley area during lulls in inflight services. I don't begrudge them the right to socialize but, I as a passenger should not be subjected to hearing personal and private discussions and opinions about diverse topics of no interest or relevancy to me. If you do not have any way to ""mute"" or ""tune out"" the unwanted conversation then it may prove annoying to overhear. The problem is that you don't have much choice in the matter because you cannot simply move your seat. Obviously, if the airplane has an AV entertainment system - use it! Or, if have your own entertainment device - use it! This is about all I can say about the seat itself aside from observing that the finish/cover is leather and the cushion is sufficiently supportive and comfortable. Realistically, to some degree, one's perception of how good a seat is will be determined by the level of service and treatment provided by the flight attendants. If you have good service and are treated well - you'll feel more positive about the seat. Conversely, if service is shoddy and you're treated poorly - then you'll feel more negative about things. On my flight service was relatively good. The only two other observations I'll mention was the AV entertainment system had issues and the overhead storage space for our carry-on baggage had been taken over by the luggage of the flight attendants which forced us to find storage space elsewhere nearby (and thus take away storage space intended for other passengers).",1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This seat was one of the more forward Economy seats on UA's flight from SFO to Incheon. United didn't sell out, so the middle seat next to me was empty. This seat would be uncomfortable on a full flight, as would all of Economy and Economy plus. But given the situation, this sear is in a convenient spot, close enough to the toilet and the galley, but not on top of it, with a good view of both main screen and smaller video screen. Nothing that UA did changed my view that UA's economy is drab these days with shockingly bad food and expensive alcoholic drinks (US$7 for a domestic beer). It didn't appear that Economy plus was much better. Leg room is inadequate, given I am short and still find the seats cramped. The selection of movies was acceptable- I did not download the app to browse through UA entertainment on line. There are no power plugs in Economy and I needed to save my battery power for work.",-1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0

WowI'm a little skeptical that you call this plane a clunker.  One of the best planes ever built. Virtually everything was right when they rolled out the first 747-100 to this one.  Its not the Dreamliner, but hey it was the cutting edge of Aviation History.  still dominates the sky as a Cargo Option Combi. The only concern now is operation cost. That's why Boeing released the 787 series.  for pilots this planes handles like a dream and responds like a small turboprop.  Only difference is the flare begins earlier due to the height. It can fly around the world making two stops.  With new Fuel additives this aircraft could see another 10+ yrs easy.  Airlines still like it as 100+ orders are coming in from major carriers for the 747-8 series.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I flew this plane before UA had begun its conversion to new seats.  Not a moment too soon!  The first class seat was a major disappointment.  Yes, it did go fully flat and allowed me to catch a few hours of sleep on the way to Tokyo, but I had to concentrate on not fixating as to how filthy the seat was when I slept.  The upholstery is showing its age and there are stains -- unidentifiable to the naked eye -- ground into the fabric.  There were still crumbs around the seat that did not look particularly fresh. I don't think it was the result of a poor cleaning in BKK but rather poor maintenance all around.",-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0

Great area to try and get some rest for a very long flight. We chose the seats due to my husband being an extremely broad shouldered man. He had extra shoulder room in seat B because there was no A seat. Those extra inches make a big difference. Yes, it is louder in the back of the plane, but we just plugged in our iPods, closed our eyes, and tried to forget about the long hours ahead. On the return flight, we upgraded to the Economy Plus seats in row 21. Nope, would have rather had rows 58-60 again. The gentleman behind us in the last row, 60, had room to recline his seat. Said he always chooses this row when on International flights.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

The best point about 7G is that you don't even feel the plane's movements. I don't even feel much turbulence even when it was announced. UA's Asian service is stellar! The Business Class (new) seats are amazing. They are so good that I flew it about 3 times - using miles as well as revenue. Too many announcements (trilingual - English, Cantonese and Putonghua) thus disrupting IFE. Food is not bad from HKG, but SUPERIOR from Singapore. A ""must experience"" kind of flight! If in Economy Plus, it's rather rough when you're flying transpacific with no upgrade.

We are traveling together and waited until 24 hrs before our flight to try to pick seats. We were assigned seats 19C and 19D which on the opposite side of the plane. We tried to get seats 16 but when we did after the 24 wait WestJet wanted to charge us $56 so have had to take what was given to us. Will try tomorrow to see if we can sit together. Hope we get better seats on our flight home on a 737.

Quite a good flight, although it was a noisy aircraft. The seats were quite narrow which wasn't good for being a 6 and a bit hour flight.

Wizz Air have a policy of not only allowing large trolley cases to be carried in the overhead lockers but also now offer a pricing policy to make money. The locker maximum weight capacity is 38KG and each locker will hold 4 of these big cases yet although they are checked for size at some airports they are never checked for weight. Recently I have experienced two lockers out of use due to turbulent weather the case broke the door catches on one aircraft and one with the same damage on another aircraft. This is putting profit above safety. The lockers are designed for a briefcase/handbag plus duty free purchases. Wizz air seats are much thicker than Easyjet so the leg room is very small in the same A320 aircraft. I have be sat in a seat where the seat in front has been broken by someone's knees and the tray was broken.

It was ok. I had no great expectations from a low cost company but the overall experience was ok. Recommend to take the priority boarding to skip the crowd at check in and boarding. I will use this company in the future for sure.

I must say that my flights was rescheduled (from 15:50 to 5:40AM!!); then your options are to cancel it and get back your money (only this leg) or change it for free to a similar flight from Wizz Air (same trip, day before at 6:00AM).
When checking-in is mandatory to do it online if you don't want to pay an extra fee (even though you're checking a bagage).
The line to check-in the luggage was chaotic and very slow, also the staff was so unkind.
The boarding was quite quickly and easy.
Even though was a flight with an unbelievable schedule, the crew didn't let us sleep because they were selling products all the time.
Also, after 1 hour in the air and beeing sleeping, one of the flight attendants woke me up to check if I was seated in my seat... I still ask myself if it was really needed to do it, after 1 hour flying and beeing asleep. I couldn't sleep more since that moment.
I could also see how a sick passenger had to lay on the floor as the flight attendants didn't want to give her a more comfortable seat. After a long time they agreed (I don't know if she had to pay the extra fee to seat at the XL seat feeling sick), even though most of the XL seats were empty.",-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

A very standard seat, with not too much legroom - but sufficient on a 90 minutes flight.
